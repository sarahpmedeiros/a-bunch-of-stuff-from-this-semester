      "b'Wellll when I need lunch and I dont wanna venture far I go to this hidden gem! Its more of a \"industry workers\" Subway bc its hidden and not too many ppl know about it! \\n\\nThe customer service is superb, and they are very quick during the lunch time rush! Here you can actually ask questions and get an honest answer about a sandwich. The prices are the same as other places and they are not  greedy with the spinach as others are! I normally get the buffalo chicken on multi grain with swiss and hella spinach and a little bit on ranch, many do not know but I am OBSESSED with anything buffalo chicken! Its like my thing! Here the grilled chicken is smothered in hot sauce and is succulent and tender! They toast my lunch up, and its not too toasty, which is awesome! Top that bad boy off with spinach and a sprinkle of ranch, and BAM... MONEY!\\n\\nI will continue coming here bc the ppl are nice, its clean, and quick!'b'its close to work, its either busy or slow.  subway cant go wrong.'b'The tally was $13.35 before my son said he would like to add a soda, now the total would be $15.14 said Perla, the sandwich maker/cashier, presumably she was reading off the register as she said that.  As I was paying, I asked her if the receipt was in the bag, she said yes.  Seeing I was ACTUALLY looking for the receipt, she said: \"Oh, it\\'s here\". The receipt was on the register all along and it seems like she didn\\'t want to give it to me at first, but she grabbed the receipt from the register finally.  As she was handing that receipt to me, she asked how old my son is, (she wasn\\'t friendly at all prior to that moment), so I answered her question meanwhile forgetting to look at the receipt.  Back to the hotel, I happened to see the receipt, it was ACTUALLY $12.65 as shown on the pic.  I also realized she didn\\'t give me a receipt for the sandwiches I bought the night before and she overcharged me more than $2 as well.  I know it\\'s only a few dollars, most ppl don\\'t even bother checking or asking for a receipt.  I see a lot of taxi/limo drivers here, and I wonder how many ppl have left without a receipt.  Speaking of receipt,  Subway has a slogan, \"If we don\\'t give you a receipt, you get your sandwich free\".  The register automatically printed their current sale code which I wasn\\'t aware of, each Subway has it\\'s own price and various codes from time to time.  Either way, discount or no discount, we pay the receipt amount, plus whatever the tip amount, isn\\'t that the whole point of receipt?  We had been here before, the service was good generally.  Hopefully this is NOT their common practice.  Two stars for them opening 24 hrs.'b'Your basic subway, except it is open 24 hours and off the beaten path. You see a lot of industry in here. I work at the law firm around the corner. Subway is always good for healthy options and I have lost some weight by incorporating subway sandwiches into my diet.\\n\\nSometimes it is also nice to be able to get a healthy sandwich in the middle of the night rather than hitting up the Taco Bell drive thru.'b'The food was good but the service was a little bad. \\nThe sandwich maker had me waiting a while because she was talking to a coworker'\n",

       "      <th>(b'Wellll when I need lunch and I dont wanna venture far I go to this hidden gem! Its more of a \"industry workers\" Subway bc its hidden and not too many ppl know about it! \\n\\nThe customer service is superb, and they are very quick during the lunch time rush! Here you can actually ask questions and get an honest answer about a sandwich. The prices are the same as other places and they are not  greedy with the spinach as others are! I normally get the buffalo chicken on multi grain with swiss and hella spinach and a little bit on ranch, many do not know but I am OBSESSED with anything buffalo chicken! Its like my thing! Here the grilled chicken is smothered in hot sauce and is succulent and tender! They toast my lunch up, and its not too toasty, which is awesome! Top that bad boy off with spinach and a sprinkle of ranch, and BAM... MONEY!\\n\\nI will continue coming here bc the ppl are nice, its clean, and quick!'b'its close to work, its either busy or slow.  subway cant go wrong.'b'The tally was $13.35 before my son said he would like to add a soda, now the total would be $15.14 said Perla, the sandwich maker/cashier, presumably she was reading off the register as she said that.  As I was paying, I asked her if the receipt was in the bag, she said yes.  Seeing I was ACTUALLY looking for the receipt, she said: \"Oh, it\\'s here\". The receipt was on the register all along and it seems like she didn\\'t want to give it to me at first, but she grabbed the receipt from the register finally.  As she was handing that receipt to me, she asked how old my son is, (she wasn\\'t friendly at all prior to that moment), so I answered her question meanwhile forgetting to look at the receipt.  Back to the hotel, I happened to see the receipt, it was ACTUALLY $12.65 as shown on the pic.  I also realized she didn\\'t give me a receipt for the sandwiches I bought the night before and she overcharged me more than $2 as well.  I know it\\'s only a few dollars, most ppl don\\'t even bother checking or asking for a receipt.  I see a lot of taxi/limo drivers here, and I wonder how many ppl have left without a receipt.  Speaking of receipt,  Subway has a slogan, \"If we don\\'t give you a receipt, you get your sandwich free\".  The register automatically printed their current sale code which I wasn\\'t aware of, each Subway has it\\'s own price and various codes from time to time.  Either way, discount or no discount, we pay the receipt amount, plus whatever the tip amount, isn\\'t that the whole point of receipt?  We had been here before, the service was good generally.  Hopefully this is NOT their common practice.  Two stars for them opening 24 hrs.'b'Your basic subway, except it is open 24 hours and off the beaten path. You see a lot of industry in here. I work at the law firm around the corner. Subway is always good for healthy options and I have lost some weight by incorporating subway sandwiches into my diet.\\n\\nSometimes it is also nice to be able to get a healthy sandwich in the middle of the night rather than hitting up the Taco Bell drive thru.'b'The food was good but the service was a little bad. \\nThe sandwich maker had me waiting a while because she was talking to a coworker',)</th>\n",

Even if you don\\'t care (or know) what Serbian food is, and if you\\'re just looking for a huge plate o\\' meat, this is also THE place to go.  Serbians really, really love meat.  Like, all meat, all the time.\\n\\nWhen I go to Prince, I\\'m usually with Serbs and we order the plate of meat for two (it\\'s enough for at least three people).  It includes cevapi (Serbian national dish, looks like ground beef sausage links), chicken, beef, pork, and some cheese-stuffed thing I have yet to identify.  It\\'s really good when you\\'re in the mood for a serious dose of protein.  I\\'ve also ordered  the beef soup which, literally, includes like a pound of smoky beef roast.  It\\'s insane.  You will leave this place doubled over in pain from the amount of meat you consumed.  I guarantee it.  This would probably be a great place for body builders to eat.\\n\\nThe only downside to Prince is that I always feel really intimidated walking in.  The restaurant is dimly lit inside and it sometimes feels like a \"Serbian only\" atmosphere.  But, if you feel self-conscious, just go outside to the patio seating and chow down on your cevapi.  The waiters are really nice and will make you feel welcome.  It\\'s definitely an experience.'b'It\\'s friday, I\\'m starving in my room after playing \"the secret world\" for 5 hrs; I decided to check yelp for something different. \\nI\\'ve found this little niche near my place without pics and decided I\\'ve give it proper pictures. We all know without pics we\\'re not going. \\nI parked in the back because driving by in the afternoon sunset was difficult to see. Really must pay attention. \\nThe restaurant is cozy, clean, and the manager who greeted me was friendly; along with the staff. \\nSince this is the first time being in a Serbian I asked to try their traditional foods. \"stuffed cabbage(beef, rice and no tomatoes)\", \"cucumber salad with tomato and feta cheese\", and \"cordon bleu\"(baked stuffed pork(homemade cheese, and ham with sour creme) along with a special homemade dipping sauce(bell peppers, tomato, garlic all hand chopped and cooked really long to make it pasty and pur\\xc3\\xa9e). \\nAppetizers are around 7ish and entrees are about 15ish. \\n\\noverall, the stuffed cabbage and cordon bleu hit the spot. :)\\n\\nAnyways check out the pics and if you want to try some European Serbian food this is the spot. \\n\\n4 stars meets my standards for cleanliness, atmosphere and the only Serbian restaurant I know out there so I cannot compare.'b\"Came here with a friend last night  Food was real good, Better than aok. Don't know if ill go back but wouldn't rule it out. \\nPros: food was tasty. Service was good. Price was great BUT\\nCons: smoking inside restaurant is gross.\\nThe say it's Mediterranean food, but not like Paymons. It's more like Bosnian or Serbian food.\"b'Amazing!!!! The \\xc4\\x8devap\\xc4\\x8di\\xc4\\x8di (sausages) are out of this world!! Best I ever had outside of Europe...by far! Fresh Bread a bottle of Karlova\\xc4\\x8dka (beer) and great service...how can you loose?'b'Very authentic Serbian Cuisine!! Place is a little small but most hole in the wall places offer the best food, and Prince is no exception! Must try the cevape, so delicious. If you love European or Serbian food this is gonna nv to be your new favorite spot!!'b\"This is nothing to compare with real Serbian food. The service is beyond terrible, the food is as well terrible. For there shopska salad, they use the cheapest roma tomatoes, and while you pay $5.50 for a plate, you have about 3 soup spoons of salad, seriously??!!\\nThe chevape who ever says are out of this world or best in there life, those people probably never ever tried authentic chevape!! They have no taste, they were over cocked, they did not even smell on chevape. Same as the pljeskavica... Tasteless rubbery ground meat. Veshalica was acceptable but again not even close to how should be. Big plater with meat for at least 3 people to eat but fries for one person...what s joke.\\nNobody cares if u enter it or not, very unwelcome atmosphere, very dark, have to use phone light to read the menu. \\nService was unbelievable terrible, the owner was there but he dose not care for customers, the only thing this person cares is to put money in his pocket. \\nWe asked for bread 3 times and ketchup as well... On the end waitress asks if everything was OK???! Seriously???\\nDon't waste your money.., and it's a lot of money as this place is very very OVERPRICED !!!!'\"b'Great mediterranean cuisine (Yugoslavian) food\\n\\nI ordered for $19.99 the small Meat Plate for one person with Pork Steak, Cevapcici, Pljeskavica, Sausages, french fries, Ajvar and salat\"\\n\\nIt was good and much meat'b\"I live in the LA area and whenever I'm in Vegas I make sure to stop here for some Serbian food! Is it 100% authentic? No, but good luck getting that outside of Chicago...it's as authentic as you're going to get in the western United States and I'm a big fan! I love their Kara\\xc4\\x91or\\xc4\\x91eva \\xc5\\xa1nicla and burek...the \\xc4\\x86evapi are OK, not as good as Aroma Cafe in LA but still good. My girlfriend (not Serbian) has had the gove\\xc4\\x91i gula\\xc5\\xa1 and sarma and she seemed to like both...I tried both and they were good, though not as good as my mom's and deda's cooking :D The service has been great here every time I've gone, MUCH better than my one experience at the other Serbian establishment in Vegas, Cafe Derbi. On that note, all the smoke is a legitimate concern and not for everybody, but having been to Serbia many times and not being a smoker myself I guess you could say I'm used to it...still, this place is WAY more ventilated than Derbi, even if it's smaller, so if you're worried about smoke while you're eating (and rightfully so) this is the better option.\\n\\nI love me some Prince...I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas! Vidimo se!!! :D\"b'Prince\\'s is right around the corner from where I live, but I\\'d never seen it before a friend took me and my fiancee out last night. \\n\\nWe got there a little early, so I pulled up the Yelp reviews, and I was worried about all the smoke that was mentioned, but looking forward to some great food. \\n\\nWe walked in, and its a dark little spot, with a bar set up in the corner, and a handful of tables. \\n\\nIt was a LITTLE smokey, and you are allowed to smoke inside.  It wasn\\'t bad though, and I\\'m very sensitive to excess smoke, but it really wasn\\'t awful. \\n\\nOur server/bartender was awesome, offering recommendations, and checking up on us frequently.\\n\\nFor drinks, the guys had a shot of a Serbian brandy, which I was too scared to try.  \\nI had a fresh squeezed orange juice with lemon drink that was awesome!  I actually had two.  My fella had an \"orangina\" which was like a non alcoholic mimosa (sparkling water with oj type of taste.) \\n\\nFor appetizer, we had sarma, which is lamb, rice, and spices wrapped in cabbage.  I would eat this all day, every day.  It was wonderful, and the portion was enough for three of us.  \\n\\nThe boys got salads with tomatoes and cucumbers, which I hate, so I wasn\\'t a fan, but if you like these kind of salads, you\\'d probably enjoy it. \\n\\nThe bread basket was great as well.  The bread was crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside...just wonderful, and went well in the \"sauce\" of the sarma. \\n\\nFor the entrees: \\nI had \\xc4\\x86evapi sausage sandwich, with homemade bread, onions, and a butter/sour cream type sauce.   The sausage is veal and beef, and was very flavorful. \\nNot 100% sure that I enjoyed it on the bread, because it fell a part a little, but I loved all of the individual aspects of the dish.  \\n\\nMy fella had Makedonska Pljeskavica: Ground steak stuffed w/ mozzarella, ham, mushroom, and cream cheese spread on house made bread. This was enormous.  I thought it was pretty tasty, but he wasn\\'t fond of the cream cheese filling.  The meat seemed to be more of a gyro meat consistency, which again, he didn\\'t care for.  I loved it though, and thought it was great. \\n\\nMy friend had Kara\\xc4\\x91or\\xc4\\x91eva \\xc5\\xa1nicla: pork loin schnitzel stuffed with mozzarella cheese, cream cheese, and ham; rolled and breaded; fries; slaw. \\nThis was the best entree, and I don\\'t like port.  lol  It was really tender, and delicious.  \\n\\nPortions were generous for the price.  \\nI have every intention of coming back, and frequently.'b\"The best way I can describe Prince is by calling it a dive bar with greasy Ukranian/Serbian food, except in a good way. The d\\xc3\\xa9cor and atmosphere are nonexistent but the staff are friendly and the food is good. They have a full bar and indoor smoking- patio seating available if you're not a fan.\\n\\nMajority of the clientele here are from Europe, so don't get offended when you're asked where you're from- it's not meant in a rude way. But don't be a stereotypical boring American diner and get the shish kabob, ask for a recommendation or pick something from the specialty entrees section and prepare to be impressed.\\n\\nI opted for the Makedonska Pljeskavica, which is a gyro-like meat stuffed with mozzarella, ham, mushrooms, and cream cheese, between two slices of soft, oily bread. Definitely split this order, as it's a giant portion AND unhealthy. Add a shopska salad to lighten things up- cucumber, pepper, tomato, and feta with a vinegar-oil dressing.\"b'One of the best... delicious  food and lovely  stuff team. I am there all the time. Breakfast  lunch diner  voffee..... thank you. Sta reci nego svaka.cast. jedan ste od bolji restorana. Bio sam u utah arizona i California  ali vi ste najbolji. Ukusna hrana ljubazno osoblje. 5+'b\"My curiosity is piqued every time I find a rare Balkan cuisine spot, and I make trying their food and testing the ambiance for authenticity a priority.\\n\\nThis restaurant is the size of an average cafe and kept dark and cool most days.  The bar at the end is typically occupied by a lot of gruff, affable Balkan expats watching sports and smoking, something we could see but not smell from our spot due to what I assume is excellent ventilation.\\n\\nDon't let the size of the venue fool you, they serve up some serious grub.  The \\xc5\\xa1opska salata was fresh, delicious, and spot-on.  The sarma was beautifully-constructed but the kisela kupus had taste/texture of having been frozen (not that big of a deal). The sampling of beers and spirits from the region was wonderful and punctated a great walk down memory lane,  We left so full and happy that we can't wait to come back.\"b\"I come here every time I'm in Vegas (from LA) , and it's hands-down the best Serbian food on the west coast! I recommend the Pljeskavica (a Serbian kebab-burger) with Kajmak, it's large and delicious. Serbs do meat right. \\n\\nThe service is good and polite and did not wait too long for the food. \\n\\nP.S. not sure why people are mentioning Ukrainian, there is nothing ukrainian in this restaurant.\"b\"Had been wanting to try this place for a couple years and it was well worth the wait. \\n\\nThe service is very good; what you would expect at a European caf\\xc3\\xa9... attentive but not overbearing. Leisure atmosphere. \\nI was glad they had Karlova\\xc4\\x8dko on the drinks menu. Even though they did not have any in stock we still enjoyed a Nektar beer. It's so hard to find these beers in Vegas. \\n\\nWe both had the mixed meat plate... First let me say, as expected the portions are enough for 2-3 people. We could have easily shared a plate between the two of us, but we were looking forward to taking leftovers home. \\n\\nIt comes with \\xc4\\x87evap\\xc4\\x8di\\xc4\\x87i, pork steak, pljeskavica, and additional meats, salat, pomfrit, and a basket of kruh. Everything was cooked to perfection. It wasn't the best \\xc4\\x87evap\\xc4\\x8di\\xc4\\x87i, but it captured the overall flavor. \\n\\nLooking forward to coming back.\",)</th>\n",

       "      <th>(b'New restaurant in Summerlin. Food was good. Nice assortment of tapas and Spanish wine. Servers were attentive and friendly. Give it a shot!'b\"I created a Yelp account specifically to warn people of this place - that's how bad it was. Of the thousands of restaurants I've been to I have never felt the need to write a review so this is a first. First of all, the food was terrible. Just on that fact alone I would never go back. In my entire life I have never sent my food back, but after my first bite of the Chicken and Chorizo Paella I looked down at this huge plate of food and had to send it back. It had a really strange after taste that I can't accurately describe, but I knew I didn't want another bite. At least they did take it off our bill, but a manager never came over. On our way out I think the guy holding the door was the manager; he asked how it was and I was honest. He just mentioned that he would speak to the chef - didn't offer a gift card or anything at all. The service was pretty bad also. One guest didn't like their drink after the first sip and nothing was offered other than to curb it by adding Sprite. Bottled beer is $5.50, drinks are about $10, tapas are roughly $6-12 and the Paella is about $35. They only have 1 draft beer. One positive is that they have a few large TVs that were easy to see, but instead of playing sound from the football game they had slow depressing music. The restaurant isn't very big either. If you were to compare this place to Firefly, it's no contest, Firefly is considerably better - I'll gladly take my chances with Salmonella. Thank god I had left over pizza to come home to from earlier in the day. Even though I live right next to it, this will definitely be my one and only experience with Toros Spanish Kitchen and Tapas.\"b\"I was hoping this place would be great! Ordered the bacon wrapped dates which I probably wouldn't order again. The chicken chorizo paella was terrible. We took one bite &amp; sent it back. Probably the worst I've ever had. Sent it back &amp; never had a manager come to the table. Our server was nice &amp; it was obvious that she had just come back from a smoke break. I don't have any intentions on going back.\"b\"I'm so excited about this place. I live in Henderson but it is worth the drive. I love the environment, kind of rustic meets Spanish. Food is unique, as it is from different regions of Spain (menu even shows origins). I moved here from Idaho where there is a huge Basque population, it is great to bring some of that culture to this city. Also, staff was very friendly and welcoming. I was very impressed that the owner even came to my table to check on our experience. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to have drinks and/or eat.\"b\"Great food , nice staff, owner came around to make sure everything was great. Don't listen to people who complain about the prices, you get what you pay for.\"b'First of all, I\\'m a major YELP user, and like most of you on here, I look at Yelp for food recommendations; however, I am a terrible Yelper and never actually post anything on here. This place was so bad, that I actually had to find time to post something to inform the public on how terrible this place is!\\n\\nComing home from Red Rock Canyon, we (party of 4) decided to give this place a try.\\n\\nThe hostesses seemed lost when I requested a table for four. She just walked in a circle around the restaurant before going back to the front to ask another hostess for help on where to seat us ?!  \\n\\nWe ordered the mussels, which were super tiny and came with half of them still closed. Why would you serve totally closed mussels to your patrons?  The dates, at a whopping $6 for three, don\\'t even have a nut in the middle like Firefly giving them no texture.  The sangria was good, however, it was overloaded with ice in an attempt to minimize alcohol content and maximize volume with ice.  The bruschetta with ham (NOT PROSCIUTTO AS IT SHOULD BE) was good, but for 7-8$ for two tiny pieces, it was way overpriced.  We also ordered Scallops, Sausage, and another item which we cancelled because we just wanted to leave and find another place to eat.\\n\\nBasically, everything is so overpriced that you will spend 40$ per person and leave totally hungry.  The quality of the shrimp, mussels, and other meats is so poor and tiny that it seems that the owners are simply taking advantage of the \"Summerlin Area\" by charging such high prices for such low quality.\\n\\nFinally, this \"Tapas Restaurant\" actually has gaming machines and huge flat screen TV\\'s all over it with football playing loudly on all screens making this a hyped-up PT\\'s rather than a Spanish-feeling restaurant. \\n\\nStick with Barcelona, Firefly, or another tapas restaurant if you want to leave full and satisfied, not hungry and ripped-off.'b\"Food is very tasty. I loved the oxtail and the crabbed stuffed peppers. I gave them five stars because the atmosphere, service and food were all pretty good and they just opend so it should only get better! It is a little spendy but that's always what i expect from the Summerlin area. The food is well worth it though and I'll definitely be going back soon.\"b'The food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun and the service is fantastic! Already been back!'b\"Went to Toros this weekend with a group of friends.  We couldn't wait until this new  Tapas Summerlin Restaurant opened.  From the moment we walked in we were pleased.  The atmosphere was very cool; loved all the reclaimed wood on the walls.  The bar in the center has a really fun &amp; friendly vibe.   Something different for the area!  The hostess was sweet,  told us immediately that they were very busy and it might be a bit.  But it was great!  Our waiter was very nice, explained the menu for us and helped us out with some favorites.  We were all very pleased!  Loved all the specialty drinks, The white wine sangria was so Awesome!  The staff seemed to all be so excited which made our dinner experience all the more fun....I am reading some of the reviews that people have written and I think that these people forget that this restaurant has been open for less than 2 weeks and it takes time to work out all the kinks.  With that being said, and with patience and understanding, this restaurant has unbelievable food, must try the Albondigas (meatballs) and the Pollo Parrilla (half Chicken) and lastly the Flan is perfection!  I love John Cutter's and wish the owner and his staff great success.  We all can't wait to go back soon!\"b\"A lot of restaurants send out appetizers on small plates and call them tapas, but for a truly authentic menu of Spanish classics there are only three choices that I know of in Las Vegas- TOROS, Jaleo and Julian Serrano. The only real difference between the food at the other two is that those places cost about two to three times more!\\n \\nI have been to TOROS three times now and I have tried almost everything on the menu (including four types of their Pallea!). Having authentic Spanish food brings back great memories of the times I spent living in Spain, the amazing sights and the friendly people.  I have been to Jaleo and Julian Serrano at least half a dozen times each, and they, like TOROS, are spot-on when it comes to authenticity.  \\n\\nBrian B. said that the pitchers of Sangria seemed expensive but at four glasses per pitcher that works out to $7.50 per glass.  It seems pretty reasonable for hand crafted and properly made sangria, especially since it's basically impossible to find even a cheap glass wine for $7.50 a glass.  I also read another comment about only having one beer on tap, but they didn't mention that it is Estrella Damm one of the most popular beers in Spain.  Having a real Estrella with authentic tapas is actually a thoughtful, authentic touch at TOROS.\\n\\nWhile eating at TOROS I met several people that actually have experience with genuine Spanish cuisine from having lived or traveled a lot in Spain or having gone to very authentic Spanish restaurants, like the reviewer Anarae A.  They all agreed that TOROS is amazingly authentic.  If there is something on the menu that you are not familiar with, just open your mind to something different and enjoy the flavors and culinary style of old-world Espa\\xc3\\xb1a at TOROS!\"b\"Toros is excellent i cant believe I see negative reviews on this place for one food is amazing.Filled with a bunch of flavor,went to dinner with my wife and our server a younger guy i believe his name was omar he was very attentive and a blast ,very easy going and very knowledgeable about the menu gave us some awesome food choices which we decided to order,so glad we did we started off with bacon wrapped stuffed dates they were amazingly delicious,ox tail was amazing,and the croquet's were very good as well ,we ordered half roasted chicken which is amazingly good , and finished off with apple banana bread pudding which our server suggested to us and again best meal we've had.Ill be coming back more then twice a week thanks to the food ,atmosphere, and the service.\"b'First time here! The owner Adam greeted us when we got here. The hospitality was great, classic rock music was very enjoyable and we loved the atmosphere. We will definitely be back!!'b\"We came for a late dinner tonight. I wasn't expecting much service-wise from prior reviews, but we had a great waiter and our food came out lightening-fast. \\n\\nThe roasted peppers were delicious, as were the crab stuffed padron peppers. My husband thought the authentic Spanish sausage was unique. I ended the meal with the rice pudding - delicious! Overall, we liked the food, albeit slightly overpriced (but not necessarily for the neighborhood), and the service was fantastic. Even the manager (owner?) came over to see how things went.\\n\\nI also had the $6 glass white sangria. It was yummy and did not seem overpriced. \\n\\nWe will be back and are happy to welcome Toros to the neighborhood.\"b\"Good food, standard pricing for tapas, good selection, great service. Server assumed we hadn't had tapas before and gave us some general ideas about ordering a selection of different items and sharing. I think they brought us one item that we didn't order, but it looked so good we ate it anyway. Really good sliders &amp; Spanish coffee (alcoholic.)\"b\"We dined at Toro's Spanish Kitchen on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was not very crowded. The dining room offers a choice of high top and regular height tables. Also, several patio tables with umbrellas. \\nOur server was friendly and helpful. Service began with a basket of bread. Orders are submitted to the kitchen electronically table side. The orders were delivered fairly quickly. \\nThe Angus Sliders (3 to an order) were tasty and have a smoke paprika flavor. If you look at the inside of the burger it may seem to be under cooked but it is actually the paprika that's mixed with the meat. The Sizzling Chili Shrimp (5 to an order) are very good. Use the bread to soak up the sauce, YUM.  Sweet Piquillo Peppers stuffed with Crab Meat are delicious. They come 2 to an order and are served in a tomato sauce. This is another winner.\\nA pitcher of White Sangria was reasonably priced and had a nice fruit flavor. \\nThe menu has a good variety of items which calls for a few return trips.\\nToro's Spanish Kitchen is a nice addition and adds variety to the dining choices in the Summerlin Community.\"b\"Ron took great care of us... Sangria is fantastic... Even though I didn't have any food, the atmosphere with the gaming is all I could as for... Great local bar\"b\"Only tried 2 dishes - squid in ink and chicken with peppers. Squid was fine but it's just squid grilled. The sauce is ink sauce - not much taste. Chicken was obviously heated - sauce was hot but chicken was like warm. It tasted like tomatoe sauce without much more than that. Overall it was ok. Nothing special nor terrible. The bread was poor but the aioli sauce was tasty. They'd do better by serving tortillas or pita. My piece of bread was a bit stale.\\nThis place is really close to where I live do was hoping it was great but it's just ok.\"b\"Last night was my first time at this restaurant, as I live on the other side of town.  First, I must say that last night's background music was fantastic, a great mixture of 80s and 90s, which was nice, as I did not feel like I was dining in a club on the Strip.  Next, service was friendly and for the most part attentive.  And the food, well we ordered sliders (good), garlic shrimp (good), calamari (good).  The dish I liked the least was the potatoes, but I think that's just about preference.  I have read the other reviews about the bacon wrapped dates, and I must say that although I understand they don't include a nut in theirs, like those at Firefly or Jaleo, I prefer it with the nut.  Again, just preference.  I thought the portions were adequate to good, and I think their prices are not much higher and/or comparable to other tapas places.  Tapas places in general tend to be higher in price, and the bill does add up as you order plates and drinks.  Overall, I thought the place was good.\"b\"A dinner for four people cost $200. For a neighborhood spot, we just couldn't imagine eating here regularly. They did a great job with the interior and it seems like a fun spot for after work drinks.\\n\\nPlus: The sliders and oxtail.\\nOur server was personable (he ended up in the weeds and we had to get his attention multiple times for dishes and the check)\\n\\nCons: The grilled shrimp and salmon had very little flavor\\nIt took 5 minutes to get our first few tapas dishes, leading us to think that they had been sitting under a heat lamp and 45 minutes to get our last two tapas dishes.\"b'Ron totally took care of our needs at the bar.  Steve the manger was totally accommodating to all our needs.  Food and drink was totally great.  Piquillo peppers were to die for.....we will be back!!'b'This is a Spanish Tapa\\'s restaurant that we stopped at on a Saturday for lunch, before heading to Red Rock Canyon.   \\n\\nThe decor is quite pleasant, and for a Saturday lunch it was not crowded at all.  The majority of the menu is made of small tapa type dishes.\\n\\nThe food was amazing and wonderful.  We shared 5 different dishes plus a dessert. Every dish we had was full of flavor and just so tasty!  With a rate of 5/5, I would imagine most the dishes on the menu would be quite good.  The service was also attentive.\\n\\nThe only thing that holds me back from giving it a 5/5, is that if I came here when I was super hungry, the bill would be far too expensive.  It is perfect, if you want a \"lighter\" lunch.\\n\\nI would most definitely return for brunch or lunch.'b'Walked in and sat down last night.  There were only 15 other people in there. No one even acknowledged us or offered to be right with us. After 15 min of sitting at the bar with not even a drink order taken.... We left and went to john cutters.'b'Oxtail was good.. other than that the flavors of the food were REALLY bland. Their flan had a really bitter sauce, that was gross.. wont be back to dine here there are so many better options for Tapas in town..'b'So we went in for dinner.  Having been to numerous tapas restaurants before we knew what to expect- basically small sharing portions.\\n\\nFirst- it was FREEZING in there.  Half the patrons were still bundled wearing their coats (I being one of them).  And, we were seated no where close to the door.\\n\\nSecond- the music was so loud that our waiter missed some of the dishes that a guest at our table ordered.  The items that we ordered, I felt like I was screaming, I had to repeat a few times until they were clearly understood.\\n\\nThird- Our waiter was horrible (and not because he couldn\\'t hear orders over the music).  When we first entered, it was fairly early dinner time.  There were other folks sitting and being waited on.  Not us.  Finally, he arrived took our drink orders.  Then he disappeared.  Drinks dropped off.  Again, he disappeared.  Time passed, he ran by dropped off bread.  Disappeared.  At the time, we were is only table.  After about 20+ minutes he finally came by to get our food order.  Disappeared.  He only reappeared to toss some food on the table.  Finally able to flag him down and ask for more bread (I wanted it to sop up some yummy morsels I left on my plate).  Without asking, he just grabbed my plate and told me I could get a clean one.  The whole point was I didn\\'t want and clean one.  It is also a pet peeve of mine when a waiter/waitress touches my plate without asking..... It was at that point we informed him that some of our food was missing.  So, after a longer wait (at this point the place was filling up) we finally completed our meal.\\n\\nFourth- Pricing.  Again, we know tapas.  But somehow, the prices did not match at all to what you were getting.  Firstly, It\\'s located in a very \"family\" style community.  There is another restaurant catty cornered to this one.  They understand this concept and although they are considered a \"tavern\" are constantly packed because of the family friendly prices and atmosphere.  Secondly, I personally don\\'t think that paying $8 for \\'tempura artichoke hearts\\' (when 3 pieces come on the plate, they were barely a mouthful each, and they obviously used canned artichoke) is worth it.\\n\\nOverall, despite the pricing, most of the food was good. The \\'sliced trio of Chorizo\\' was extremely greasy and oily.  \\'Bacon wrapped dates\" I\\'ve had better.  Bacon was nearly burnt, they were served over shredded lettuce that made no sense, and there was no sauce. The \\'Gambas con Arroz\\' for the price ($8) was worth it.  My only issue with that was again, canned mushrooms and canned peas.  \\n\\nAt this point, I think I\\'ll stick to my other tapas restaurants.  I feel they are a much better value.  For dessert (because I couldn\\'t take the waiter anymore, I was uncomfortable frozen, and the music being so loud we couldn\\'t have a conversation) we opted to go to the grocery store across the parking lot.'b\"The hubs and I ate here for lunch on Friday and was pleasantly surprised. It's a sister property to John Cutter, which we don't think of as impressive since the service always sucks. That's another review though. \\n\\nWe started off with one of their signature cocktails, I had the cranberry fizz and he had the bloody Caesar. Although the drinks were pricey, they weren't watered down or tiny. The first thing that came out was their bread, and honestly it was the best bread I had at a restaurant in a long time: super rustic and crusty, served with some sort of aoili. The Manchego cheese plate was really good too. Stuffed Piquillo peppers, just ok. Garlic shrimp: well cooked, but I expected a little more flavor and punch. Meatballs: succulent and flavorful. I was slightly put off by the continuous use of red sauce, though. \\n\\nI love the decor of this place and it certainly helps that it's a short walking distance to our house. I really hope that it does well so the neighborhood has more options besides John Cutter.\"b'It\\'s \"TAPAS,\" not \"TOPLESS.\"\\n\\nThis restaurant located at the corner of W. Charleston and Desert Foothills opened on November 1st, brought to us by the same group who run John Cutter right next door.  \\nI enjoy tapas places because you get to sample lots of small plates, ordering more of those you like.  It\\'s a mini-buffet that comes to your table.\\n\\nOur group of four ordered:\\n-bacon wrapped dates:  unlike another tapas place in town, these are really dates wrapped in bacon.  The dates are not stuffed with anything except their own sweetness.  Solid.\\n-meatballs:  I needed a dish with more protein, so I ordered these.  Nothing spectacular.\\n-bread and butter:  carbs!  \\n-oxtail:  my favorite dish of the night, which I only had to share with one friend.  I could have had another order all to myself.  Fall-off-the-bone meat and a nice sauce to go with it.\\n-ahi:  I\\'m allergic to fish, so I only looked at this.  The friends liked it.\\n-garlic shrimp:  I had one.  Nothing special.\\n-asparagus:  this was another winner for me.  The grilled spears tasted great.\\n-croquetas:  deep-fried cream cheese, bechamel sauce, and ham (I think)--what\\'s not to like?  I liked.\\n-manchego cheese:  served in three chunks with some toasted bread on the side.  I like this cheese, but wish it had been sliced for us, or at least give us a cheese slicer so we can do it ourselves.\\n-Serrano ham:  too salty, but that\\'s just me.\\n-flan:  YUM!  The sauce has cinnamon in it.  My pal could have done without the cinnamon, but I loved it.\\n\\nI also had a glass of the red sangria, which was not too strong, just the way I like it.\\nOur server, Omar, was very attentive the whole night and the food came out very quickly.\\nThe bar in the middle of the room has video poker machines and there are several flat screen TVs throughout the restaurant, so this is a great place to come and watch sports in a non-smoking environment and with good food that isn\\'t your typical bar fare.\\nOverall, a great time was had by all.  It\\'s a welcome addition for the locals who live in the neighborhood and we\\'ll definitely be back.'b\"Very good food and even better service.\\nThe only thing to criticize is that they always play classic rock. I love classic rock just as much as the next guy, but the music doesn't quite fit in with the place. The music zaps the energy right out of a place that could have a really awesome atmosphere.\"b'I really enjoyed the food and service, excellent food but I do agree with other reviewer about the music. \\nMusic makes a huge difference while you are dining, and in the case of this restaurant continuous classic rock does not match the food served. Literally I want to go in, have excellent food and get out ASAP, because the music is draining. Hope they change it or mix it at least!!'b'Reading over the reviews submitted so far for Toros, I am baffled.  Most yelpers rave about the wonderful food; the few exceptions thought the food was fine but too pricey.  I couldn\\'t disagree more with either camp.\\n\\nFirst, the food.  I have a fairly strict standard for eating out:  Trader Joe\\'s frozen entrees.  Huh wha??  Lemme \\'splain ... a while back I discovered that Trader Joe\\'s offers remarkably good frozen food - no, not as good as making everything from scratch with fresh ingredients, but orders of magnitude better than any other frozen cuisine.  After sampling a few dishes, I decided that if a restaurant wasn\\'t noticeably better than TJ\\'s frozen, it\\'s just not worth it.  That\\'s when I decided to never again eat at the likes of Friday\\'s, Bennigan\\'s, Outback, etc.  Mind you, the restaurant doesn\\'t have to be fancy.  I\\'ll eat at a hot dog stand, as long as it serves really good dogs.\\n\\nAlthough Trader Joe\\'s doesn\\'t offer Spanish tapas, I\\'m pretty sure that if they did, they\\'d be a helluva lot better than the menu at Toros.  Wow, what a morass of mediocrity.  Started with the chicken in saffron sauce and the braised oxtail.  The chicken had no flavor (just bland white meat chicken), and the saffron sauce just tasted like a generic cream sauce, straight out of some bottle.  The braised oxtail meat was OK, but the sauce it was drowning in was off.  If I kept the meat and vegetables out of the weird sauce, it was OK.  Then I ordered bacon-wrapped dates, grilled asparagus, and seared salmon.  The bacon-wrapped dates tasted awfully generic.  I don\\'t know what the difference is, but the b-w dates at Jaleo are a thousand times better.  The grilled asparagus with aioli was the best dish of the night, although that\\'s damning with faint praise.  And the seared salmon with spinach and garlic sauce was nowhere nearly as good as whatever frozen salmon dish at Trader Joe\\'s.  I didn\\'t realize it was a garlic sauce until I saw it on the menu just now because it tasted like flavorless white cream sauce (tasted the same as the supposedly saffron cream sauce - I\\'m guessing Toros\\'s \"saffron\" is Yellow Dye #something).  The salmon was overcooked, therefore a bit dry and lacking flavor.  And the spinach was horribly salty.  Finally, on to dessert.  Apparently the Spanish version of rice pudding is rice pudding with cinnamon sprinkled on top.  If you\\'re craving rice pudding, buy it at Costco - Costco rice pudding is worlds better than the stuff at Toros.\\n\\nThe atmosphere left me somewhat annoyed.  The server/bartender (I ate at the bar) was very nice but got a bit annoying because instead of asking me how things were, she kept asking, \"Isn\\'t everything just amazing?  Isn\\'t the food fantastic?  Don\\'t you just love it?\"  No, no, and HELL no.  I ordered a glass of sangria, $6 for cheap red wine mixed with 7-Up and a lot of ice.  Toros is also a \"Nevada-style pub,\" which means they have video poker at the bar.  For most of my meal, there was a group playing the machines, and they were quite raucous when celebrating every little win.  I\\'m not criticizing them, but be prepared for that if you eat here.\\n\\nThe one thing I\\'m not criticizing at Toros is the prices.  The menu prices are all very reasonable.  I had a 50% off Groupon, but even at full price, my bill for the large quantity of food I ordered wouldn\\'t have come to much.  Also, they have happy-hour (forget the hours) when a lot of the items are half-price.\\n\\nIf you\\'re idea of a great steakhouse is Outback or great Italian is Olive Garden, then you\\'ll probably love Toros.  Me?  I\\'ll save my money for Jaleo.  If I had the opportunity to eat 52 meals at Toros for the same price as 1 meal at Jaleo, I\\'d savor the meal at Jaleo and enjoy my heated-up Trader Joe\\'s the rest of the year.'b'Found this place by happenstance while trying to find Albertsons. We came in on a Monday and discovered their half off tapas special. We admittedly went a little crazy and boy were we glad we did! The tapas was amazing. We ordered the grilled asparagus, tempura artichoke hearts, sea scallops, calimari, ribs, and ox tail. All of these dishes were incredible. \\n\\nUnfortunately, they were out of the escargot. Guess that leaves something for next time! :) We finished dinner off the Spanish coffee and the lava cake. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back and with friends/family too!'b'We are so excited that there is a neighborhood bar to go to besides John Cutters! I don\\'t have a penis, don\\'t gamble nor do I play golf-yet I get great service unlike the \"sister restaurant\" next-door ... Ronald and Rheanna are such professional and friendly bartenders who are all we could ever hope for!!! Manager Steve is great also. People who complain about food have so many other places to go within a five mile radius - happy trails to you all! We are very content at Toros. The happy hour is great-I hope they keep it !!!'b'Great food, very good selection. Love the atmosphere.Will go back. Highly recommended.'b'I have been here two times and each time was scrumptious! The decor is really cute and they have mason jars at the table holding silverware. Extra point...bc I love mason jars. Now on to the meat of the matter..literally. The oxtail is amazing! The meat is tender and the flavor burst into your mouth with every bite. The dates are good and so is the calamari. I am a girl that loves my sauces and the 3 sauces that come with the calamari are really good. The Sangria is yummy as well. Look for groupon deals so you can get a bang for your buck. Overall...Toros Spanish Kitchen &amp; Gaming will def be in my restaurant rotation!'b'The service is good, very attentive employees.. The decor is pretty modern and pleasant.. However, the food is not that good.. I tried the stuffed piquillo peppers, which were pretty decent. The croquetas were pretty soft and not very tasty. The safron chicken was terrible and the bacon wrapped dates were just ok. The best thing we tried was the gazpacho, good portion, good price and there was a lot of meat on it! They also have a happy hour menu, 4-7 and 11-2 am. Drinks and some tapas items have a good price but truly the food is not that tasty that is not even worth it.'b'My wife and I went for diner tonight for the second time, the food was magnificent. It reminds me of the Mediterranean rivi\\xc3\\xa8re, when my wife and I were there on our honeymoon. We are very happy that this great restaurant for Spanish cuisine is finally near by on the west side. It was a wonderful experience, please do not change anything. This was a wonderful experience, I recommend it to anyone who likes spanish cuisine.'b'I have no idea how this place is ranked so high. Everything that we ordered before the main course was bland;salad, \"saffron\" chicken, bacon wrapped dates, calamari. All had no taste. The chicken tasted like chicken soup base with boiled chicken. The worst offender was our main course, the seafood paella. \\n\\nFor a $36 shared entree you would expect something tasty that you can\\'t wait to go back again for, but it was awful. the paella was. It honestly tasted like rancid vegetable oil with boiled vegetables and mushy rice. I couldn\\'t find any chorizo or chicken which would have added flavor. The seafood was there, but guess what? Totally lacking in any kind of seasoning. The clams were also full of sand and it was very unpleasant having spit out grains of and with each bite. I actually am getting pissed off thinking about this because our check was pretty damn high. We actually left a little hungry because we didn\\'t want to finish the main course.'b\"We got there around 10:15 pm and we decided to wait for the Happy Hour at 11pm. We got Estrella beer (which is really giod),Seafood Soup and meatball with fries fries for the kids. All this before 11pm. The soup was ok, 2 mussels, 1 clam, 1 shrimp and few pieces of some white fish that tasted really good. \\n\\nAfter 11 we got the Chix Wings, Pan Boli, Saffron Chicken and Fried Calamari. The chix wings where really good. The calamari was better. The batter stayed crispy after 10 mins, which is weird to find a batter like that. Pan boli it was great for the soup. 2 pcs. of baguette toasted with jamon serrano, manchego and EVOO.  \\n\\nThe Saffron chicken a disapointment. No flavor, no seasoning, no saffron. Looked like a turmeric puree on top of chicken.\\n\\nThe service was ok, but there was problems between customers and the bartender. Some people left so disapointed that even the manager couldnt fix whatever issue they where having. \\n\\nMaybe I'll be back but this town is getting so full of Tapas Bars that is getting boring.\"b\"We came here last night for dinner. \\n\\nWe were greeted and sat immediately. The hostess was very friendly and our waiter was very attentive. \\n\\nThey don't have a large portion to choose from on their menu for tapas - but all of the tapas are half off on Monday's, which is super nice. \\nAlso, the wine list isn't very large. But they have a full bar for everything else. \\n\\nWe had a fairly decent number of dishes -\\nAngus Sliders\\nStuffed peppers\\nArtichokes\\nFilet\\nScallops\\nAsparagus\\nLava cake\\n\\nEverything was okay. The garlic aioli...if you don't want insanely strong garlic in your mouth for hours, steer clear. \\nMost of the dishes were fairly bland and there wasn't much to them. \\nEverything came out VERY quickly - the waiter said they don't let anything sit in the window and it's all made fresh, which was bizarre because a few of the dishes he brought out were barely luke warm. So, I don't believe that was the case.\\nIt seemed in a way that he was doing his best to convince us that the food was good. \\nHe was a great waiter, but the food...it was mediocre. \\n\\nI can't see myself coming back again...I like good food, especially when I'm paying for it. ;)\"b\"I really really wanted to love this place. It looked great from the outside and walking in, the decor was well done. It is clean and inviting. However, although we were the only two customers in the entire store during lunch hour, the service was still very slow. The food was overpriced and not very good.  At the end of our lunch we waited quite a while and no one brought the check. Finally my friend just got up to find an employee. I will say that I don't gamble or drink so I can't rate those items.\"b\"The atmosphere is very nice and quite comfortable. That's the good part of our visit to Toros. I found the food lacking any seasoning or taste. Has the chief heard of salt or pepper. Portions are very small, we ordered the braised rib we got one piece which was about 3 inches by 3 inches over mashed potatoes cost $8. I understand small plates but most tapas restaurants plates are at least large enough for 2 people to share. At best the food is bland  and not worth the prices they charge. I certainly hope they rework the food. I don't mind paying more for really good food, but I do mind being overcharged for poor food. I don't normally compare one restaurant to another since each should be able to stand on their own but honestly FireFly is hands down so much better.\"b'Poor service from the moment we walked in the door. No hostess available, so we stood there waiting. I noticed the hostess cleaning a table in the corner of the restaurant. She looked up saw us standing there and went back to cleaning the table. (there were quite a few clean empty tables already, so i don\\'t think continuing to clean that table was imperative. Were finally shown to a table by a server and given menus. Waited at least 10 minutes, then busboy asked for drink order, then brought us our water. a different waiter showed up, no intro, and just said \"what can I get you\". we ordered and he zipped away. Food was not very good at all, except for Calamari. Plate presentations were terrible. Sauces slopped in the serving dishes, no garnishes, smudge marks just thrown together.  They overcharged us $1 dollar for the sauteed mushrooms, and when I brought it to the attention of the waiter, he was like \"aahhh, ookaay, I\\'ll tell the manager\". As if my issue was petty and undeserving. Brought us the check and still hadn\\'t corrected the price overage, stating that he did tell the manager. I can only assume the manager didn\\'t think the change was a big deal either. I have to guess, because I never saw a manager. Too bad, i wanted this to be a good place to go since we live right up the street, but I guess we will need to continue to patronize Firefly for our Spanish tapas fix.'b\"I'm not claiming that Toros has the best tapas in town, but they are good enough for me to come back.  I've been here just twice and I'm a fan. \\n\\nHere's what you get at Toros...\\n-Smoke Free\\n-TV Screens (a lot of them and perfect for the game)\\n-Great Service\\n-Spacious Joint\\n-Inexpensive mini dishes (i.e. tapas)\\n-Happy Hour Specials (look for the red star on the menu)\\n-New Establishment\\n-Not too busy\\n\\nTapas (My Rankings):\\n-Oxtail:  My goodness, this is good..ness.  It's a bit rich, but nothing beat their fall off the bone oxtail.  Perfect with rice. \\n\\n-Asparagus:  Grilled to perfection. I think I can eat two orders on my own.  \\n\\n-Bacon Wrapped Dates:  Pretty good.  Not sure what was better, the bacon or the dates.  Regardless, still tasty.  \\n\\n-Meatballs:  Not the best that I've had, but a good addition if you're looking to add some meat to your diet.  My opinion, the sauce was a little runny. \\n\\nThere's a lot more that I've tried and a lot more on their menu that I haven't tried.  For now, it's their oxtail and asparagus that keeps me wanting more. Thumbs up for price, value, and selection.\"b\"I was looking forward to having a new neighborhood spot that served something off the beaten path but I left feeling frustrated. We went for a nightcap and I had a pretty decent glass of Tempranillo. We ordered a bottle of Pellegrino and when we got the bill we were shocked that they charged $10 for a 24oz Pellegrino (medium sized bottle). This is absurd and when we asked the bartender, she agreed that the pricing for bottled water there is off the wall. It may sound trivial but I feel that I was completely ripped off. This pricing is not fair in the least bit and needs to be re-evaluated. \\n\\nI have not eaten there yet so I can't speak of the food quality but I honestly might not make it back in because of the ridiculous pricing issue.\"b\"I live around the corner from this place and was disappointed. More on the expensive side for what it actually is. Came at 11 when it was supposed to open and had to wait awhile before they actually did.  When the server finally came out she made eye contact but said nothing.  It has so much potential but with the service and price it's just a disappointment.  Just about anything else could be better and it's too bad anything else isn't in this shopping center.  I swear  Toros and john cutters only stay in business due to the prime location.\"b'As I read these reviews, I can only imagine that there must be some correlation between the quality of food, and which night each chef works...we went on \"half priced tapas Monday\", and the only thing that wasnt great, was the saffron chicken(very bland and mushy)...but since it was half priced we must\\'ve ordered 13 different tapas and all the rest were spectacular... I recommend the potatoes, steak, scallop, hell even the escargot was pretty good..'b\"Went here last night. Mondays are the night to go - 1/2 off tapas. It was busy, but probably because it was on a Monday.  Also, I liked that there is no smoking. \\n\\nThey had a pretty good selection of tapas. We probably tried about half of them.  Here is the list: \\nPil Pil Shrimp - came out sizzling hot in a cast oven pan. The shrimp were good sized, I think there were five or six shrimp in butter, garlic and other seasonings. \\n\\nCalamari - Tried both the fried and the grilled. I liked the grilled calamari better than the fried. Decent portion size, not huge but it is tapas. The calamari was still tender and the grilled had a great flavor and was served on squid ink.  The fried, still good, a light batter. There was one sauce missing, it is supposed to come with marinara and two aioli's but it only had one aoili.  \\n\\nStriped seabass - This could easily by a small meal, one piece of fish.  It was still tender. I liked the onion and peppers it was served with. The fish in itself did not have much flavor. \\n\\nStuffed piquito peppers - There were two in the order. I could have ate a whole plate. Grilled peppers stuffed with gooey cheese - need I say more. \\n\\nFried Manchego - I love cheese curds, and this was like the spanish rendition. The manchego was a little salty, but Manchego is.  There are three wedges provided - it was tasty but a bit greesy I may skip this in the future. \\n\\nPan Bohli - Two pieces of breach with serrano ham and cheese on it.  Good, a little greasy as they grilled the bread - but nothing really noteworthy so I probably would skip this again. \\n\\nI can't remember the name but sausage on potato - the waitress recommended this. It was good but I would probably not get this again. There were four servings/pieces - the sausages were about an inch long and although they had good flavor they were a little tough. They were sitting an a small mound of mashed potatos. \\n\\nThe normal tapas price ranged from $6-$9 approximately. For the size of the items I think the price is a little high for the amount you get, but for 1/2 days it is a steal. We also got a pitcher of red sangria ($26) - it was okay, but not very sweet and had a more prominent wine taste than you normally get in most sangria's. I prefer it to be a bit sweeter. \\n\\nI was also impressed that they had Estrella beer on draft (the only place I have seen it) and $6 for a 16 oz poor which is good. Their wine list was also reasonably priced and although small they had some decent wines, not the normal Chateau St. Michelle etc you always see. I can't remember the list but I noted that they had Tobin James Cab. \\n\\nThe waitress was nice and the food came out quick. Also they have half off sangria on Thursdays and happy hour from 4-6pm and 11pm-2am with 20% off tapas, and drink discounts for beer, wine and well.  Overall I liked it here for the price, I would come back on Mondays or during happy hour.\"b'Go elsewhere.  \\n\\nService is mediocre, at best. \\n\\nFood is bland. \\n\\nFirefly down the street is much better.'b\"Came in on a Saturday night.....crickets!! We were the only ones there. The door is off to the side so glad it was propped open as we wouldn't have know it was open. Music going immediately greeted by bartender. Ordered the pomegranate fizz something. It was awful. Pomegranate juice instead of syrup would have made all the difference I think. My husband wanted a beer, they only have one on tap and don't offer Dos Equis amber. Strange since there a Spanish bar. We also tried they sangria sunrise, that was tasty. The bartender was great and made lots of suggestions. We must have brought a good vibe because after about 15-20 of being there it started to fill up. All the while he was on point with everyone. We ordered a  Siracha chicken sandwich on their reverse happy hour menu. It was basically a chicken sandwich with siracha on it. it was gross. So the menu needs work but bartender was attentive and suggestive with out being pushy. \\n\\n Also gaming machines all around the bar......way too many. I don't gamble so when there's a lot of machines it makes me feel like I'm taking up someone's spot. I think they could take out half of them and still have a great flow of gaming. I don't know if it's offered but maybe some live entertainment on the weekends. We in Summerlin love a spot we can lounge, eat and drink with live entertainment.\"b'We ordered 4 items from the tapas menu and all I can say is why was everything luke warm?  Tried the seared calamari based on other reviews and it had no flavor despite all the dark sauce on the plate.'b\"This place kinda blows, it's pretty on the inside. The service is pretty weak. The food is always lukewarm, doesn't really have that fresh taste quality. I've gone twice now and the only appealing part was the rice pudding. Sucks because john cutter's is always on point!\"b'Terrible food quality and very disorganized. Very disappointing.'b\"Went to Toros for a dinner on a Friday night.  Service was good, but could have been better.  I had to flag our waiter down for utensils which weren't on the table but no big deal.  In other Tapas restaurants I'm used to the waiter coming over pretty frequently to check if you want anything else since they are small plates.  \\nWe ordered an array of tapas including the padron peppers, pil pil shrimp, and ox tail.  We also ordered the pork sandwich.  The peppers were tasty but I probably wouldn't order again.  The pil pil shrimp was excellent...lots of flavor and cooked very well.  I would skip the ox tail next time although it was done well.  The sandwich was terrible...dry with no sauce on it.  We ended up dipping it in the pil pil shrimp sauce which wasn't bad, but definitely do not order this.  We will probably be back to check this place out again, but it won't be a regular dining experience for us even though it's close to home\"b\"My hubby and I go out for Happy Hour once a month on Fridays. I get off work early and we head to a new place by 4:30 or so. Having read a few positive reviews and since this place is pretty close to our home, we thought why not.  The weather was in the high 70's today and nothing is as good as a cool crisp sangria on a warm spring day.  Of course the sangria has to have some flavor, which this one did not \\n\\nOur server was good and very attentive.  The place was pretty empty but it was 4:30 so it was to be expected. We asked our server for some recommendations and ordered the bacon wrapped dates, the scallops, the sliders, some shrimp and the peppers. Everything was just ok. The dates were not as good as Fireflys and we only received 3 of them. The scallops had a sauce made with cinnamon that was a little off putting and the shrimp were way over cooked and had zero flavor. I couldn't talk my husband into eating the last slider either. \\n\\nOur bill was $60 which is pretty expensive considering how small all the portions were, it was also supposed to be happy hour but they only discount their Tapas 20% off the regular price. \\n\\nAll in all not a place we'd return to again Next time I'm in the mood for sangria I'm heading back to Firefly.\"b'AWESOME PLACE! JUST DON\\'T  ORDER THE FOOD!  Love the atmosphere.  Love the service (Shout out to Ron! You are THE BEST!).   Love the gaming.  Love the music.   Love the picking my own utensils from the Mason jar.  But the food, AAAARRGH!  TOROS - I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED BUT YOU NEED TO STEP UP YOUR GAME WITH THE FOOD!!!  The reviews about your food being lukewarm and bland are absolutely true! The only thing you have going for you now is a captive audience (i.e. those of us who live nearby and appreciate a place close to home where we can hang out on a weekend night).   I tried you when you were new and the food was, well... lukewarm and bland.  The service was okay.  I held off on writing a review and decided to give you a second chance a few months later figuring you needed some time to work out the kinks.  The service has greatly improved, but the food... UGH!  How can you mess up CHICKEN?   I ordered both the Saffron Chicken and the Roasted Chicken.  They were horrible.  I took them home and fed them to my dogs.  That\\'s expensive dog food.  As I write this review, I am stuffing my face with a bag of popcorn from Costco to get the \"ewe\" feeling out of my stomach.  Anyway, the lukewarm and bland food will eventually drive people away.  You\\'ve got one more shot, Toros, before I throw in the towel.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'ll still show up occasionally to gamble, drink Sangria, and hang out with Ron, but I will NOT order any food.'b'Wow! This was our first time eating here &amp; we loved it! Everything was great, the service but even better was the food. A must have is the Bacon Wrapped Dates &amp; for sure the Paella Valenciana. The shrimp in the paella was perfectly cooked. Chef Oscar Sanchez even came around to greet the patrons. A job well done :-)'b\"My go to lunch and dinner spot near home! I have been here about 5 or 6 times now and have figured out the best things to order:\\n\\n-beef tenderloin with chimichurri sauce \\n-asparagus with romesco sauce\\n-Spanish chicken wings\\n\\nGo on Monday for half price tapas! Skip the drinks unless it's happy hour, though. \\n\\nFinish your meal with the lava cake. It's to die for!\"b'WOW! This was our first time eating here &amp; we loved it. Everything was great from the service to the drinks and the food was.even better. A must have is the bacon wrapped dates &amp; the Paella Valenciana. The shrimp in the Paella was cooked perfectly. Chef Oscar Sanchez even came out to greet the patrons.'b'While food is good, the service experience is unacceptable. No hostess available and we were sat down by one of the servers. The server took 10 minutes to greet us at the beginning. Since we had time to analyze the menu, we were ready to order drinks as well as food. \\nWe had: Calamari ( needed a few more seconds in the fryer), cantimpalitos ( excellent), tortilla (good), scargots ( probably canned, sauce was great). Bread service was good. Skip the sangria saince it was weak and watered down. \\nBack to service: not even one table check, we had to waive for service for several minutes while being ignored by several staff members. We ordered round two of tapas, no table bussing or drinks offered. \\nWithout going into technical service issues, the staff need to be trained in genuine customer service. Smiling and general hospitality were completely absent from the place. Server was obviously \" in the weeds\" without a busser or assistant for the entire table turn. \\nWill I be back? \\nMaybe for an order to go....'b'The food was great. But even for tapas, too small.'b\"Half-price tapas can always make a manic Monday better!  Monday eves, my BFF and I try to drop by and sit at the bar to catch whatever game is on, maybe play a game or two, and savor comp drinks and half-priced tapas.  Our favs include the seared salmon, served atop a bed of spinach and drizzled with a b\\xc3\\xa9chamel sauce (omg, I refuse to share this plate with anyone); the arroz con pollo savory rice with tender chicken; and whatever else calls to me.  BFF smacks her lips at the sight of this ahi dish she requests and licks her fingers and plate after devouring her salty-peppery garlicky seared shrimp.  It's been fairly busy the Mondays we've been there, and a bonus is that either she or I is usually lucky at the video games, so it's an inexpensive fun dinner.  Background music is great, the staff is always friendly and welcoming, plus service is prompt.  What I really LOVE and appreciate is that it's a non-smoking environment and I don't leave there smelling like an ashtray.  Maybe to attract a clientele all nights and to keep things rolling through the week, the owners should promote a Happy Hour every week day ... not just Mondays!\"b\"Took awhile for our server to come take our orders...only ordered a Barcelona sandwich and everyone's order came before mine...even other people who got there after us...my sandwich ended up taking 45 minutes to come out to me...and it didn't have the cheese that the menu said it was supposed to have so I sent it back to get cheese and when it came back out half the bread was missing and replaced with a piece of sandwich bread. Asked to speak to the manager who was not even there so the head chef came out and was telling us how they are usually slow on Sundays and ran out out a lot of stuff, I told him I was not paying for my meal...turns out he comped our whole meal. Never going there again\"b'Our awesome server Manny G was great with the service and was even better exposing us to new drinks. New drinks that were not in the menu were a treat. My friends and I return to restaurants constantly due to their cocktails and food. But mind you the cocktails keep us coming. Thank you Manny for the great drinks we (6 of us) hope we see these in the menu soon. Thanks so much Firefly!!!'b'This place really got my taste buds going! Everything they brought out was so incredibly delicious! I found this place on Groupon &amp; immediately checked Yelp for reviews! Decided to try it due to my undying love for Tapas! It was 40$ worth of food for 20$. \\n\\nToros is actually a gaming restaurant as well &amp; I do appreciate that it\\'s a NON-SMOKING gaming restaurant. That actually why I gave this place 5 star rating instead of a 4.\\n\\nCocktails- when you text Toros to 99158 , you can get a free drink! So I did &amp; my first cocktail was Strawberry Bojito! It tasted like a Mojito &amp; I\\'m a fan. My second drink was a white sangria. Oh gosh, worse sangria I ever had. lol only bad thing about this whole review was that darn white sangria. \\n\\nFor foods! \\nStuffed Piquillo Peppers 7$- It was stuffed with crabmeat and goat cheese swimming in a tomato sauce. BUT, it only comes out with 2 peppers (as seen on my picture) so when it came out, me &amp; the beau looked at each other like \"that\\'s it?\" But boy was it delicious! \\n\\nSliders $9- those were cute. I didn\\'t really think anything special about it. Only thing different about it is it had a slice of ham in it which added a bacon effect to it. \\n\\nSeared salmon $8- one of the best salmons I ever had! It came out with saut\\xc3\\xa9ed spinach which was so good! It was laid on a garlic sauce which was oozing with flavors! \\n\\nMeatballs 7$- It comes with 3 juicy meatballs. Nothing really to say but it was delicious! \\n\\nBuffalo wings $12- of course everywhere we go we the beau ALWAYS has to get buffalo wings! These were really spicy and it came out with a spicy aioli dipping sauce! That really made those chicken wings memorable! \\n\\nFlan- &amp; for Dessert, my favorite! It was the perfect amount of sweetness and was the perfect size to end our meal. \\n\\nThe waitress was new but she had a lot of knowledge about the items. She was honest  about not trying most of the foods yet but gave us direction on popular items. She came to check on us regularly and when our food was taking long she would go &amp; see what the hold up was. She was a doll!'b\"I really like the deco of this place, but the service and quality of the food didn't justified what I had to pay.  We had to remind our waiter two out of five orders did not come.  Food quality was average.  I live one mile away of this tapas, wouldn't go there again.\"b'The tapas were all good, nothing really wowed us, we did try their tequila rice pudding and loved that they sugar carmelize the top like a creme brulee.  What takes this to 4 stars is the service.  We, like many reviews went with a Groupon, unfortunately during happy hour, I asked to speak to the manager and he agreed to put in our order after happy hour ended in the computer so we could use the Groupon.  That was A1 customer service.  After that experience we will return!  Thank you.'b\"We ordered a few items on the tapas menu. Food is okay although some of the items reminded me of Julian Serrano's menu. The execution was decent but the food didn't taste very good. One thing though: I noticed the other reviews mentioned how small the portions were; yet all of the items we ordered came in huge portions! \\n\\nYou're probably better off going elsewhere for tapas.\"b\"Great casual atmosphere.  We had the sangria,  escargot,  paella, and tequila rice pudding.  Everything was excellent.  It was my first time having escargot and it didn't disappoint. Chef Oscar came around and spoke with us. We even added him to our Facebook.  Great to speak with a chef with such passion about his food.\"b'A rating of 2.5 would be appropriate.\\n\\nSince we were there to watch a basketball game, I asked the bartender to change the channel on one of the overhead screens and advised our waiter to be prepared for a leisurely dinner. \\n\\nWe started off with a glass of pinot noir and a Fat Tire at happy hour prices plus orders of grilled eggplant (2 slices of grilled eggplant topped with goat cheese and tomatoes) (2.5 out of a possible Forks), bacon wrapped dates (2 Forks) and pil pil Shrimp (21-25 ct shrimp in a garlic, paprika, white wine and parsley sauce. (3 Forks).  The latter was served on a hot plate and proved to be the best of the tapas though the shrimp were slightly overcooked. \\n\\nOn the second round we ordered seared salmon over spinach topped with bechamel sauce (2.5 Forks), ham croquettes (2.5 Forks) and piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and crab with tomato sauce (2.5 Forks).  We thought portion sizes were very small given the price and very average quality. \\n\\nFortunately, I had a Groupon.'b\"I live right near here, had seen it go up and never went to it.  Randomly decided to take the lovely special lady friend out to dinner and chose this place.  Needless to say, we were both very impressed.\\n\\nThe service was outstanding and friendly, the food was outstanding (we shared one of the huge Paella dishes - fresh and outstanding), and had a few drinks and a salad.  Pretty damn pricey, but nice to eat well and not have to be super decked out, naw'mean?  The live music is a really nice touch and the overall vibe of the place is great.  Definitely not the kind of place I'd go to every weekend, but for special occasions it is awesome.\"b\"Nothing at this place was good except for the company, which I brought.  The $36 paella is not worth a penny.  And the sangria, don't get me started.  I don't know if the food was worse than the drinks or perhaps the do**** waiter should get the prize.  Save your dough and just don't go.\"b'Service was great! Food was either bland or too salty. Sangria is tasty. Entertainment was great, nobody seemed to notice but us.  Would come back for sangria and entertainment.'b\"Don't really recommend the bacon wrapped dates a little too dry and not a lot of flavor.  The garlic shrimp where perfect and the ahi tasted as if it were spam from a can. I was a little disappointed with the Ahi because it's usually my fav were ever we go. We tried the strawberry bajito yum-o. Bartender took along time to make drinks and there was maybe only four of us in the whole restraint.\"b'How can you beat super cold beer on the tap?  Ordered the chicken skewers and a chicken tostada salad with my wive and it had amazing flavor.  I would highly recommend this place...'b'Love this place! The chef comes out to greet you! He remembered that I was a gestational diabetic and made sure he made the food for my needs! Also, you can get a gambling card and they give you a free $25 when you hit a 100 credits... I hit that in 20 minutes!'b\"The Staff is super friendly.  The machine are horrible.  Have a drink and run because you can't win!!\"b\"I love this place. The tapas selection was so yummy I couldn't decide. Omar, our waiter brought my husband &amp; I his choices. OMG absolutely perfect. First was bacon wrapped dates. Then pil pil shrimp, oxtail, a little later was ahi tuna &amp; tenderloin with Brie. Jalape\\xc3\\xb1o margaritas are a must have and the sangria is heavenly.\"b\"After several visits to John Cutter's next door, we were tempted away to Toros. Being a long time Tapas fan, and with Firefly in the news every other week, we really wanted to like this place. After reading mixed reviews, I was concerned, and hungry...ok, more hungry than concerned.\\n\\nI have a rule about new places. I assume that the servers know what's best. I often ask the servers to bring me the best, and leave it at that. Some servers shudder, some embrace the challenge, some know their menu so well, they barely blink before deciding what to bring. Our server, Omar, was the third type. He quickly decided on three items, all perfect, then two more, still perfect. What did we have? Well, come on by and ask your server. You see, our drinks and menu items were tailored to our tastes. Your experience may be different, but I hope, equal to our experience.\\n\\nI saw a lot of poor reviews from a few months ago, but my understanding is that they have a new chef. Check it out, it may be better than you had previously experienced.\\n\\n-Skacey, former Elite :-)\"b'My husband and I went here after a day of looking for houses in the neighborhood, loving tapas we fantasized about this being \"our spot\" when we bought a house nearby.  \\nThe decor is a little odd, flags all around the bar, and near 100 or so pier one type tin lanterns with the stars punched out (you know the kind...).  Booths all in one corner, and large enough to fit 8, I personally don\\'t like high tops, so sitting here felt super odd.  \\nWe sat waiting for a waitress to come over for about 5 minutes while it wasn\\'t busy at all... not the end of the world, but something you defiantly note the first time you go somewhere new.  Being a spanish tapas place I ordered chicken nachos and my hubby ordered the chorizo, meatballs, and bacon wrapped dates (all tapas).  I know that tapas are served as their done, but being that nachos are chips on a plate, cheese, and then into a salamander to melt i totally thought those would be first.  No wrong, all 3 of his dished were served at the same time the bread was brought out... like literally less than 5 min after ordering.  I thought it to be strange at first, but upon tasting it was clear this was all reheated food.  The chorizo was hard, like the texture of a giant slim jim that had been left on a counter for a week.  The dates just rated off, almost as if the oil they\\'d been fried in had dent been changed in quite a long time.  The meatballs didn\\'t gross me out as the other two did, but hey, you can keep those sitting in sauce and it\\'ll keep well.  \\nI had moderate hopes for my nachos as they were hopefully freshly prepared being that they were not served immediately.  nope.  \\nNow its not hard to make nachos, as described earlier.  When I ordered I asked if the optional chicken was shredded or chunks, and our waitress said shredded, I was expecting the type of cooked in a salsa, until the chicken falls apart shred.  This was like canned chicken sent through a food processor, more baby food than \"shreds\".  \\nIn addition to this, the plate consisted of chips, shredded cheese(not fully melted btw), and olives. No peppers, no salsa, no sour cream, a plate of chips with cheese, olives and chicken.  \\nSo none the less we won\\'t be back, I can\\'t see where these good reviews came from, we did go on a sunday afternoon, so maybe at the slower times you get the crappy food? I don\\'t know.'b\"Been here several of times. So many times I can't remember. The sangria is amazing the tapas are absolutely delicious!!! Must try the sliders or anything!!! We love it all!!! Service is great!!!!!\"b\"It was my wedding rehearsal dinner and I really wanted tapas for all the different tastebuds attending.  It's also sports/video poker bar, so not a romantic setting, but I didn't mind.  Some of my guests wanted to gamble anyway.  The executive chef, Oscar Sanchez, and the manager, Lisa, took real good care of me.  We went over the menu, the timing of the dishes, the different diets in our group, and I even was able to order dishes not on the menu.  How accommodating!  The service was impeccable, the prices reasonable, and the presentation mouth-watering.  Everyone attending was impressed with the entire experience and left with happy bellies.  Thank you, Toros, for taking care of us.  I'll always visit when I'm in town!\"b\"Absolutely love this place! The food is great and the service is even better. I highly recommend the seared calamari with a side of bread to dip in the ink sauce!\\n\\nThis last time I tried the paella and it was definitely delicious! It's enough for at least 3-4 people so come hungry!\"b\"I have been here twice now. First time it seemed expensive so I avoided it for a long time. In search of something different we ventured here again and while it wasn't as expensive as I remember the food just wasn't quite on. \\n\\nMargaritas: way too much sour. I didn't finish mine. That never happens. \\n\\nEmpanadas: seemed frozen/reheated\\n\\nDates: can't go wrong here. Tasty but only 4\\n\\nTenderloin from tapas: tasty. Potatoes weren't the real deal but I thought it was good enough. There was something cheap about the steak. \\n\\nCorn cakes: sugar bomb. I honestly didn't taste anything corn about these guys. They were dressed with maple syrup seemed more like a pancake. The bf enjoyed them so they got a few points. \\n\\nAll in all, tapas are no bueno. I will try one more time because I like the area, but I'll go for an item off the menu -- sandwich or entre.\"b\"Just witnessed a few Duck Dynasty looking bikers wielding foot long army knives reach over the bar, grabbed bottles of alcohol, and walked out.  But it gets better...they walked back in, sit down at the bar, and are getting served shots.\\n\\nWith 1 waitress, 1 female bartender, and 1 bus boy manning shop, not sure if they saw it or just ignoring it.\\n\\nEither way, I would not recommend bringing your kids or date here. \\n\\nOn the food:\\nBraised oxtail is good\\n\\nScallops so-so\\n\\nSeared prawns were sent back as all of them were mushy and rotting.  Even the Buser said it stinks when he took it away\\n\\nThis place doesn't seem like it would be around after another few months\"b\"This is not a good restaurant experience. I think this restaurant is about to close. \\n\\nAmbiance: Empty restaurant on a Wednesday at 8:30pm. Hip hop - pop music at Spanish restaurant. Gang members with unconcealed weapons and lit cigarettes in a non smoking restaurant. \\n\\nFood: seafood was rotting and had to be returned.  Even the sangria was poorly made, although drinkable.    Rice pudding had decent flavors but was not finished cooking (rice was hard and liquid had not yet been absorbed).  Oxtail was good. Ahi tuna is tasteless. Fried artichokes are sour and runny. \\n\\nService: very nice waiters but have not been trained in proper service steps. All the tapas came out at the same time and couldn't fit on the table. \\n\\nConclusion: it's not good enough for their price. Good news is that the next restaurant in this space might be better!\"b\"I'm not sure how I feel about this place after my one visit on early Sunday evening.  It's walking distance from my house and they have an outside sitting option which is a bonus for me if I have my dog(s) with me.   It's an expansive and varied menu but pricey in my opinion for a neighborhood bar.  The server suggested the tapas menu on the back since we weren't really interested in a meal.  We ordered a pitcher of Sangria for $26.  Way to high!  It was about 6:30 when we got there so we just missed happy hour but really for a local neighborhood bar I would probably be a frequent visitor if that happy hour was all day or even if there were more drink specials available.  Like John Cutter next door you can get a free drink by signing up by text.\\n\\nFor tapas we chose the calamari, ceviche, and the chicken skewers.  A complimentary bread basket with dipping sauce was also provided.  I have no complaints about the food and the tapas were fairly priced.  The restaurant was larger then it appeared outside but almost empty minus a couple other tables.  The bar is large and offers gaming so that's an option if you're a fan of that.  \\n\\nBecause of it's proximity to my house I can't say I will not find myself here again but I will make sure I arrive when happy hour is still in effect.\"b\"Most UNAUTHENTIC spanish restaurant I've ever been to.  Stopped in for a drink and tapas and left after the drink.  The whole ambiance just isn't there. Based on other reviews, I'm pretty sure I didn't miss out on a whole lot.\"b\"Giving this place one star in order to write my review.\\n\\nMy bf and I were there on Thursday night. We were both starving!!! We sat down and were greeted promptly. We ordered an appetizer and a few different tapas.\\n\\nBacon wrapped dates (our favorite tapas) came out super HOT! My bf burned his mouth. The bacon was really fatty which explains why it was burnt.\\n\\nEmpanadas had a mushy meat which resembled pur\\xc3\\xa9ed (?) old shredded beef...not good.\\n\\nCrocketas were deep fried but super soggy??? How does that happen? and who knows what was in them. It was supposed to be chicken with b\\xc3\\xa9chamel sauce but tasted more like a Campbell's cream soup---wait generic cream soup- Campbell's would've actually helped--- w chunks of who knows what. I've had b\\xc3\\xa9chamel sauce and that was not it!\\n\\nChorizo was served cut into tiny pieces 5 pieces altogether and was so oily that some of the oil ended on my shirt...goodbye silk blend piece :(\\n\\nFinally we decided on gnocchi...pasta right? You can't mess this dish up- I've made it myself at home with OTC sauce...well surprise! Salty and gnocchi tasted so un fresh!\\n\\nI will not return to this place. Seriously! My bf even said he would much rather take his chances on the other more known tapas place then step back in here. How is this place still having people come in and order FOOD? Clearly these people lack a trained palates or maybe they lost their taste buds in a freak incident. I went home and - I kept wondering what was in those Crocketas and empanadas. The thought of how old the food was...it was too much for me.\"b'Love stopping here for a quick drink and tasty appetizer.  The gnocchi is consistently spot on, delicious!  Friendly, prompt service and outdoor patio seating...just hold on to your hats on windy days!  Overall, I always look forward to winding down here :)'b\"I watched this place sit idle during the Great Recession and then was so pleased to see something going in there when the economy improved.  Toros Spanish Kitchen &amp; Gaming is a good addition to the small shopping center.\\n\\nWe stopped last night and had dinner.  I had looked over the menu online but I wanted to look at theirs in house as there were other items than the tapas I'd seen online.  Our server brought iced tea.  We had to wait a bit to catch the server's eye to get some Sweet 'n Low but eventually we got it.\\n\\nThe complimentary toasted slices of bread were nice.  I used it more for a pusher than anything else.  \\n\\nI ordered three items to start_an order of saut\\xc3\\xa9ed mushrooms in garlic and sherry wine, gnocchi with shrimp in a garlic cream sauce (I thought I'd be able to sneak the shrimp past my wife), and last, an order of croquetas with ham, cream cheese, and b\\xc3\\xa9chamel.  \\n\\nThe winner of the trio was the gnocchi with shrimp.  When my wife got to the one shrimp I hadn't been able to screen out with the spoon, that was all for her.  Score for me--I finished the dish.  The gnocchi were soft and the shrimp, although small, were good.  It was a nice combination.  Next, the garlic mushrooms were really good.  Saut\\xc3\\xa9ed nicely in garlic and sherry, the mushrooms were very good.  The disappointing dish for me was the croquetas.  They were very light and had hardly and body to them yet it was difficult to pick them up.  They broke in half.  There was not a b\\xc3\\xa9chamel sauce but a marinara like sauce.\\n\\nWe decided not to order more.  The three dishes were filling--well almost.  We ordered the chocolate lava cake.  It takes 15 minutes to make (the menu states this clearly so if you're in a hurry, order early).  The lava cake was rich chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  A nice way to end a good dinner.\\n\\nService was spotty.  Our server seemed to be nowhere in sight for much of the time while the server who had the tables on each side of us seemed to be at those tables all the time and the place was not that crowded.  During dinner, the owner came around to ask how things were and the personal touch is always appreciated.  It's also very good business.  The spotty service kept me from giving Toros four stars.\\n\\nI thought the pricing was very fair.  If you subtract the desert we had from the bill, the total would equal about what I paid for 1 person at another tapas place and I left hungry.  Two of us ate for the same coast and we left without feeling hunger.\\n\\nWe need to come back and try some of the other dishes.  I also need to come back with some friends and without my wife.  There are items I'd like to try from the menu that she won't eat!  Her loss.  Time for a UYE?\"b\"My husband and I had a Groupon for this restaurant and decided to give it a try since we were new to the Vegas area. \\n\\nWe were sorely disappointed when everything we ordered was significantly lacking in flavor. I don't even think salt was used on any of the dishes. Tapas are supposed to be packed with taste-bud tickling flavors and that is definitely not what we received.\\n\\nI will continue to go to Firefly on Sahara instead.\"b'Food was OK. $16 for nachos with beef added is pricey in my opinion, definitely take advantage of the Groupon. Never been to a bar that didn\\'t make strawberry margaritas, and never been told \"we don\\'t make frozen margaritas!\" $9+ for a drink and you can\\'t crush ice in the blender? Won\\'t be going back.'b'DO NOT GO HERE!  Brought to you by the same lousy management and food purveyors as John Cutter.\\n\\nLousy food, I am surprised I did not get sick from the fish.  Tiny portions and very little flavor.  Also, be careful when you write a bad review about any of the lousy Corrigan restaurants because you will get a petty little note from the owner - \"Adam C\".  Here\\'s an idea: if you have bad reviews and poor feedback from guests - invest your time and energy into listening and making changes instead of striking back.  If anyone else gets these messages, make sure to avoid their other restaurants: John Cutter and Sedona.'b\"Been here a couple times for tapas and it's always been a pretty good experience. Last night we had the seared scallops, padron Peppers, pil pil shrimp, chicken skewers, calamari, and the lava cake. \\n\\nEverything is well prepared but I did not care for the chicken skewers because it was not white meat. However, the lava cake is definitely worth the 15 mins wait. \\n\\nBtw there's a groupon right now so don't miss out!\"b\"I had a Groupon for $40 bucks to spend here so that was a plus. The atmosphere was great nice layout very inviting large big screens showing the games the bartender and waitress super friendly and nice. the food hoever not so nice. We had the garlic shrimp swimming in butter but no flavor, the brava potatoes were decent, the carne asada street tacos were the best part of the meal but the rice and beans were dry with no flavor. We also had the wings and they were eh just tasted  like they were rolled in hot sauce and covered in cheese. I won't be back.\"b'Poor service, and just okay food.  The tapas were too small to share and nothing was really that great.'b\"We were excited to hear of a new tapas restaurant in the neighborhood.  We stopped in excited to try this place before heading to a show, only to walk in and discover it felt like nothing more than a PT's kind of vibe.  We sat down at the bar to order a drink and dine, the bartender had a bit of an attitude letting us know she was very busy (but the place didn't seem that bad!), we finally ordered one drink, but the bartender took so long to come back that we were so turned off by the place, we never even ordered food....\"b'I went here with my dad and wife.  The food was okay; a bit pricy to get everyone full.  The only bad thing was the prawns; they were not deveined.'b'Love this neighborhood joint.  They recently revised their menu. Although I miss some of the old menu, their current selections are quite tasty.  I really love their bacon wrapped dates and Tempranillo wine. Their sliders and stuffed piquillo peppers are worth a try! This is a nice, causal, laid back restaurant. For an added bonus, they have lots of TVs. I will definitely be back for football season.'b'Great atmosphere! My recommendations (2 of the recommendations with a great server) are the braised oxtail, ferran adria beer (great summer ale), manchego cheese, pil pil  shrimp. Definitely will be coming back for more.'b'Positive - beer, as well lively sports bar atmosphere and decor.\\n\\nNegative - coffee, soft drinks and food was not at all good.  Unless they dramatically improved the fare, I would not recommend this place to anyone.'b\"They changed the menu Mexican, Cantina style food, delish. I think they've even dropped the prices. Jalape\\xc3\\xb1o margarita is going to revisit in the morning - hot, hot.\"b'Oooooo FAIL.  Ok so its late and you\\'re thinking \"man I want some food...hey that place is open...lets check it out\".   We were the only people there to eat...others were there chatting up the bartender and gaming.    Guys... How in a place with only 2 customers do you serve cold... Not luke-warm but cold tacos?   Chicken nachos were pretty good, but cold tacos?  Hey I get it its late, but either you\\'re open for business or you\\'re not.   sorry guys'b'I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant specifically because it advertised as serving Spanish cuisine.  The marquee outside still stated it was a Spanish kitchen.  After viewing the menu and talking with the waitress, she stated that the Spanish menu is gone and that they only serve mexican food.   The service from the waitress was good.  The food was just okay.  We were very disappointed with the erroneous advertisement and lack of Spanish food we were expecting.'b\"First time back since they changed the menu and I'm happy so far.  New menu is clean and simple.  Spanish/Mexican but done right.  Great taco selection and go to Mexican favorites.  Much more reasonably priced and I no longer feel overwhelmed.\\n\\nSo I got the chimichanga.  Crispy and we'll presented.  Love the spicy and tangy red sauce that covers it all.  Overall just a great flavor.  Let's me know I definitely need to come back and explore the menu some more.\"b\"What an interesting place.  We stopped here for lunch on our way out to red rocks park.  Excuse my surprise, as I'm not from vegas but it was interesting to see gaming here.  \\n\\nThis is a pretty good restaurant with some interesting tapas.  We decided to just be surprised and let the waitstaff bring us whatever.  I think the Arepas were the highlight.  The bacon wrapped dates were interesting, but perhaps a little weird to eat hot dates.\"b\"We were there before they changed their menu and were a tapas restaurant. Before, the food was delicious and since they've changed it, it's horrendous.  My bf got the chimichunga and he said it was just a bunch of meat and cheese that they rolled up to make it a big burrito. He said it tasted like nothing, no flavor.  I got the shrimp taco which also tasted like nothing but I can taste the chared shrimp. I also got the fish taco and del taco's fish taco is  actually better than theirs and finally got their veggie taco. Our waitress said the veggie taco was her favorite...it had no taste whatsoever. It was basically a bunch of meat and cheese and veggies made to fit in a taco. \\n\\nOh, our appetizers was plain nachos and it taste like pepperoni pizza rolls with guacamole and sour cream on top.  The pizza rolls itself taste better than their nachos. It seems like they fried their chips and then added cheese and baked it and then added the pico, guacamole, and sour cream.\\n\\nOverall, the place was better as a tapas Spanish restaurant and before they changed their menu. We will not be going back to toros.\"b\"Vibe is great in here, a mix of an American sports bar with delicious Mexican food. Clean restaurant with a friendly staff. I ordered fish tacos and black beans, both were very different than I've ever had but I'm not complaining. Definitely going to become a regular to this place.\"b'Pleasantly surprised with the new menu...thank you. Much better than what it was.  The Happy Hour tacos were excellent, as was the shrimp ceviche.'b'Food was cold and not true Spanish tapas. Would never go back even with a Groupon. No windows which made me feel like I was in a dungeon.'b'Man what a disappointment! Went in for tapas and they changed their menu to Mexican food. Nothing special about the food here anymore, just another mediocre Mexican joint in Vegas.  I will not be returning. The tapas were excellent with lots of variety and flavors, sad to see the menu change.'b\"wow...just wow.....never again! !!....there's just to much to say.....was never given happy hour prices. ..was out of 3 different beers.... was told I had to buy a bowl of guacamole (for $5.00) when all I wanted was aside... $6.00 for a draft beer ...the manager words to me were...SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY\"b\"Came with a co-worker for lunch...everything was really good!  Carne Asada nachos had a large amount of meat and had a lot of flavor.  Had pork sopes which were even better!  Had good spice lots of meat cooked perfectly!!  I'm saving the best for last...the tacos!!  I had a barbacoa taco my friend had the pork al pastor...the flavor on both was amazing!!  Service by dusty was really good especially since it was just her and a runner.  Next time will be for happy hour!!  Enjoy!!\"b\"Great neighborhood spot for drinks and snacks on the patio. It's not our go-to spot for dinner even with the new menu, but you can't beat the beer, wine and taco prices during happy hour. We love to stop by any night of the week for a quick drink and let our little one burn off some energy running around the patio. Service is a little slow outside, but once you let them know you need help, they're always friendly and accommodating. Manager was very nice when we had an issue with the bill. We'll continue to go here and probably give dinner another try eventually, but for now, we love the happy hour. We also enjoy the occasional live entertainment.\"b\"Went back to toros for dinner tonight.  Had a groupon and at the end of the meal they tried to tell me that alcohol isn't covered by the groupon so be careful because it doesn't say that ANYWHERE on the mobile app.  Quit disappointed since we love the food and Diana took awesome care of us .\"b'I\\'m not a huge gambler but I\\'ll put $100 in throughout the night when I go somewhere. Me and 2 friends went in and had a total of 6 drinks between all of us and two orders of tacos and a quesadilla. Tacos were good but the chicken quesadilla came out as all sauce and peppers, very little cheese or chicken. The bartender grabbed me another that was considerably better than the first. Because of this the bartender said,\"This drink is on me\"... I was appreciative of this... But other than this I saw the bartender on his personal phone taking a call 3 times and didn\\'t seem to care when I had a cash out ticket waiting at all. Like I said, I\\'m not a huge gambler but I put in a total of $100 and playing blackjack went up and down quite a bit while playing. The check comes, all drinks were charged for except for the one,\"He took care of...\" Many better gaming spots to go to than this, good service and gaming is found elsewhere...'b\"The food is amazing!  Very authentic.   I felt like I was in the heart of Mexico.   Our server, John, was more than kind and very a tentative. Loved the tocos, and the bowl was a very innovative.   Homemade torrtillas chips.  I was thrilled with the meat selection and the red and green salsa.   We'll be back for sure! !\"b\"The worst service - so slow - over 5 minutes just to get a menu, another 5 to get drinks then another 15 just to get food.  Oh wait we never got our food because the server said I had to be patient (translation: you're going to get your food whenever its ready).  We finally walked out since we never got anything.  Never again\"b'We originally went waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out here because of a Groupon. The Tapas were AMAZING and thoroughly enjoyable.\\n\\nOf course, they got rid of Tapas and went with a new \"Mexican\" menu...because if there\\'s one thing Las Vegas needs more of in the dining scene it\\'s less diversity and more Mexican food. Everything sounded great, but every single thing we ate felt like it was missing one ingredient. They tried to get all \"artsy-fartsy\" with the menu and it turned into SWING AND A MISS. \\n\\nThe first batch of chips we had was not just \"salty\" it was more like OH MY GOD, HOW CAN ANY HUMAN BEING PUT AN ENTIRE ROMAN CENTURION MONTH\\'S WORTH OF SALT ON ONE BASKET OF CHIPS?!?!?\\n\\nThe head waitress was adorable and very wonderful. She\\'s the only reason they get two stars.\\n\\nIf you\\'re the owner of this place, GETTING RID OF TAPAS WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA!\\n\\nFeel free to let us know when you reinstate it, then we\\'ll happily give you more of our money.'b'For a \"bar\" with a restaurant it is great\\nGreeted at the door\\nQuick attentive service\\nBut wait the best at the last.. We had fajitas of the steak type and they were delicious and super fast to the table\\nMargarita great\\nBeer well that\\'s beer\\nChips and salsa great\\nHighly recommend stopping in'b\"Bring Back The Tapas\\nWhy give up a concept that you executed well to embrace one that you don't. Service is great and drinks good, so if that is all you want this is a nice neighborhood place. Don't go for the food...chips are too thick, the 2 kinds of salsas are tasty, tried 4 kinds of tacos - none were good. Black beans were the best dish we had!!\"b\"This is absolutely the WORST Tapas-turned-Mexican rest in the Valley. Luckily we had a groupon... We ordered the Guacamole (which we were told isn't made until it's ordered) which was a lie because it was freezing cold and had a brownish tinge to it. It was also covered in Cotija cheese, so the flavor was that of cheese. My husband ordered fish tacos, but was served shrimp tacos. Sent those back and received the fish tacos (which state on the menu that it's fresh tilapia. Tasted anything EXCEPT fresh, and there was a 2 inch piece of fish covered in cabbage and lettuce. Absolutely the worst taste ever. Tasted like it was thawed from the freezer. We tried this place once when they served Tapas and it was less than mediocre. Found out it was owned by John Cutter (next door).. Food quality is very poor. Don't waste your money, even if it's a groupon.\"b'Went there the other day, the food was great I had the sopes and shrimp empanadas. It was delicious. I would definitely go back!'b'chef ricky makes the best  fish tacos, Chix. Adobado, shrimp empanadas, huaraches with 8oz stk.  Sopes, nachos, papas Freitas with cheese, queso modelo.i recommend this restaurant.  Great staff. Definitely coming back'b'Robin, Jessica and Gene are awesome!  Good gaming bar!  Jessica and Robin all about making perfect drinks and very attentive and Gene took the time to teach me how to game a new game!   Get a glass of Cava!!!'b'Enjoyed spending  Thanksgiving with the Toro crew dedicated to working on a holiday eve. Jen &amp; Niki took super good care of us. Thank you. DustyLee turned on the mixologist in her and made some super yummy pitchers of cocktails perfect for everyone.'b'Our waitress was very personable, helped us finalize our beer and food choices. All delicious, especially the chicken fajitas. Enjoyed watching a football game too.'b\"I've been here three times and held back writing a review the first time only because I saw many subpar reviews. But after my third visit, I have to write about this place because they deserve it. Toros has some great food but it really depends on what you order! There are definitely dishes that are a HIT or a miss. After looking at the menu for a few moments, our server returned quickly and asked us if we wanted to put in our order early. She said there was a party of 15 that has been seated but wanted to put our order in first so we wouldn't need to wait so long. Wow! Now that is some great service.\\n\\nThe interior is pretty cool and doesn't look too much like a restaurant or a bar, but a neat combination of the two.\\n\\nWhile you're waiting they serve you chips and salsa. The chips have that authentic, home-made crunch and taste. I'm pretty sure they make it in the restaurant and are terrific.\\n\\nThe carna asada tacos are to die for. Not only do they taste amazing, they are like $2.50 each. 3-4 of these and you'll be pretty filled. DON'T get the fish tacos because they were less than stellar. If you want seafood then get the shrimp tacos.\\n\\nI ordered the carne asada bowl and for the price you get a pretty big bowl. The ingredients taste really fresh and appetizing. The best part is all the food came out in less than 10 minutes. Not only was the service great but speedy.\\n\\nFor two people the bill only came out to $18 and I was stunned because it felt like we ate a meal worth twice that. Since moving to the Summerlin area, this is the first place I talk about when people ask me about dining. I've been here three times and they have exceeded my expectations each time I've been. Will definitely recommend!\"b'I\\'m not sure how this place stays open. The idea of the Tapas sound yummy but their food isn\\'t very good at all. It\\'s a wanna be \"Firefly\" type restaurant with a sports bar atmosphere.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates and a few other tapas. The bacon was almost raw. My girlfriend ordered something with shrimp. The shrimp plate was a tapas plate with 5-6 shrimp... My girlfriend ate one shrimp and didn\\'t like it, sent the plate back. I\\'ve been here a few times (with Groupons)... I doubt I\\'ll ever return. Their drinks were ok but not worth the trip.'b\"Had our employee holiday party here- staff was great about organizing our event on short notice! Location is decorated on a Dia de los Muertos theme with rustic wooden benches and chairs, and hanging lanterns. \\n\\nFood was solid: variety of nachos, taquitos, quesadillas, and enchiladas available, along with churros for dessert. As for the drinks,  the sangria has an interesting spice to it but the margaritas were the major hit of the evening.\\n\\nNot a place I'd rush back to, but nice and dark for a quiet date night or some late night snacks and drinks with friends. It's a bit out of the way for me, personally. Experience having an event here was a positive one.\"b'Was quite surprised to enjoy a very tasty carne asada torta the other day. It came with hot and tasty fries, too. Good sandwich!'b\"Nice atmosphere, generous portions and great service. Was here mid day so can't speak to the vibe at this place which is open until 6am.\"b\"1.5 stars: but let's be honest, those stars are all for the food.  The food here is delicious, well prepared, and would make for a great and affordable lunch, dinner, or HH.  Whether it's the taco plate or the chicken enchiladas (go with the red chili sauce; the green couldn't be more mild), you'll be in good shape eating here.\\n\\nThat being said, the service was absolutely horrible.  It's a Sunday afternoon, and there are four parties outside and about four inside.  Two servers, one bartender, one busser.  Still took ten minutes after seating for the server to come to take a drink order.  We then ordered drinks and a side of a guacamole to have in advance, which came out right away... But no chips.  We ask the busser for chips and she says she'll be right back.  10 minutes go by.  Ask the other server: she says she has to get our server to help us out.  8 more minutes.  Finally one of us just go back to the server and ask for chips to eat the guacamole with.\\n\\nWhat was really obvious and kind of pathetic in the above scenario is that the servers and bussers aren't working together; they seem to be competing.  And when that competition ruins a good meal, it encourages me to advise others not to waste their time there.\"b\"I wish they still did the Spanish tapas thing but now they have a Mexican menu. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food you can do a lot better than this place. The chips they gave us to munch on had a burnt aftertaste. I ordered the taco plate and the rice was bland and tasteless, the beans were overly salty, and the taco meat wasn't seasoned properly. Overall a very disappointing experience. The only reason I'm rating two stars instead of one is because our server was friendly.\"b'Great food. Good music..Dusty Lee &amp; Gene slinging great drinks..what more can you ask for? When the weather is right they have a nice patio for dining \"al fresco\" also.'b\"Let's start with the drinks. The margaritas are in no way authentic tasting. They taste as if they are premixed and purchased at your local grocery store. The sangria was not a sangria, but rather a wine put on ice with a few diced apples added. \\n\\nMoving on to the service, the host had zero personality and mumbled everything. Our server was pretty good, but the food took at least 20 minutes to get out. For Mexican food, that is far too long.  The salsa with the chips and salsa tasted store bought. The only redeeming quality was the chips. They were good. \\n\\nThe entrees were pretty bad. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, drive far away from this place. If you are looking for sub par Mexican food, then this is the place for you.  The tortas tasted like Greek gyros. The tacos were ok, the carnitas was seasoned well, the shrimp was masked by globs of guacamole, and the carne asada was dry and tasteless. The fajitas were good, but they provided way too few tortillas and too small of tortillas, then had the audacity to charge for extra. \\n\\nWill not return to this place.\"b'This place was great the first 3 weeks of been a spanish tapas bar, the down hill. When you see that the bartender is promoted to cheff , woooo, RED FLAGS STAR POPPING UP.  Now is a mexican place, way diferent. The quality is unmentionable, the services is a joke.'b\"Another Groupon purchase. Someplace new for us. It's a quaint little restaurant. I loved the decor and atmosphere! Service was friendly. Food was okay, prices the same. Dessert was great! All in all, it was our first time there and most likely our last. Worth trying once but doesn't compete with my favorite Mexican spot.\"b'Been here several times and love it. The veggie tacos are my favorite thing on the menu. I am not a vegetarian, but these are seriously good. Chips are hot and fresh, salsa is great- green is a bit sweet and red is just right.'b\"Service was good, atmosphere was good, food was fantastic.  The chicken tinga taco and the carne asada taco are two of the best tacos I've ever eaten, and they were only 3.50 a piece.  The staff was very welcoming of both me and my dog--the outside patio is a great spot for casual dining.  Not sure why there are 1 and 2-star reviews for this place, I had an entirely positive experience.\"b'We really love this place!  The food is fresh and flavorful and the wait staff delightful.  After a hike at Red Rock Canyon, this is our goto spot.'b\"We tried Toros for the first time last night.  We are regular at John Cutter's, but wanted to try something new.  We were all pleasantly surprised by both the quality of food and level of service.  We sat outside and Spenser took care of us.  The service was attentive and he made great recommendations.  The food was also very good.  All four of us ordered different items and we all thought they were delicious.  We had to take one star away for the lack of some traditional Mexican favorites (combo platters, cheese enchiladas), but all in all this was a very good dining experience and we will certainly return.\"b\"I should of known better. An empty mexican restaurant on a Friday night is never a good sign. \\n\\nI got the taco plate. 3 tacos (carne asada, shrimp, and barbocoa) black re-fried beans and rice. The carne asada didn't have any flavor and the tortillas tasted stale and cold. The rice and beans was just as disappointing. \\n\\nMy wife got the Carne Asada Fries. The fries weren't salted and soggy. Meat was dried and had no flavoring. And the cheese, the cheese was the worst part. Cheese tasted like it came from a cheese-wiz bottle. Man. That was the worst part. Lastly, my sister got the Ceviche that came out brown and looked nothing like Ceviche. \\n\\nI could never recommend this place. Sad to say. Great atmosphere, but the food is awful\"b'Please please please put as much effort into the food as the decor. Place looks great. Tequila shrimp salad was 7 or 8 tough (must have been frozen) shrimp on a chopped head of iceberg. No flavor but the sugar in the dressing. It was horrible.  Margarita was like a grocery pre-mix. Protein burrito bowl was as one-note as the salad. Even the salsa and beans needed salt.'b\"My husband went here on a whim despite the reviews. He asked for crunchy tacos for me, they made one crunchy and the rest soggy and soft. Not good. The flavored were strange and they didn't seem to compliment each other. All around the service wasn't good and neither was the food. We are here on vacation and will not return to this restaurant. So many other great choices here in Vegas! Save your money and go elsewhere!\"b\"Very happy with this place.  Our server Diena was really good. \\n\\nWe had a party of ten. Six kids four adults all with different orders.  Our server got it perfect.  \\n\\nThe food was really good. Value was much better than then expected.  \\n\\nI didn't care for the choice of music in the background or the gaming at its he bar.  \\n\\nRestaurant was very clean.  \\n\\nWe will visit again next year when we are in town.   I do recommend this place.\"b'Arrived at Toros not knowing what to expect. Walked in the door and was promptly greeted by Dusty Lee. Was almost stunned at how friendly the service was.  She immediately asked what I wanted to drink and I was served quick. My friends arrived a bit later and we all enjoyed a great time at the bar. Gene the manager was great. Thumbs up for Toros!'b'Food was amazing! Got the tacos and the ceviche.   Our bartender Dusty was awesome. Great personality and very personable. Highly recommended this place.'b'Stopped on the way back from Red Rock and wow amazing food for just running across it roadside\\nBathrooms exceptionally clean\\nBig booths. Nice decor. Super friendly service \\nI had the taco salad with steak so yummy\\nMy husband had three tacos he said the they were all great and different but the chicken one was in a super good sauce\\nThe rice was really flavorful \\nAwesome!!'b'We had dinner at Toros, it was truly amazing. The food was very good, lots of flavor, great presentation and portions are big, and Chef Ricky has a heart for his talents! Thank you!'b'Good food and great service. The cucumber Margarita was so refreshing. The chicken and carne as ads tacos and protein bowl were great. The portions are large enough to share easily.'b\"I love this place. Happy hour could be expanded but it's way decent. The chicken tinga taco-amazing. Beer prices for happy hour-amazing. The service? INCREDIBLE. We went for a celebration in my dads memory and dusty lee was our bartender, Orlando was our waiter/bar back. I can't say enough about how attentive they were and when they realized what we were gathering in memory of they just made it more special. When strangers go out of there way to make your dads memory special....I don't care if it's your job. Thank you.\"b\"I'm coming back again! The food was great (done by Chef Ricky) service was excellent given by Laura and the margaritas were delicious. Laura took the time to explain the menu. Was extremely welcoming and knew what she was doing!! Chef Ricky we will be back to try your great food! It's a 30 min drive but well worth it!!! :)\"b\"I've been here twice now, both times with friends and our kids. We love sitting outside and letting them run around and play. \\n\\nThe kids meals are tasty and only $5 or $6. Since they are pretty large portions, it's enough food for us to share a meal with them... Score! \\n\\nThere are lots of specialty cocktail options, beer, and wine. It's a nice place to sit, talk, and enjoy an adult beverage... or two!\\n\\nThe servers are attentive, the food comes out quick, no complaints on customer service here!\"b'Excellent service food was great pricing very affordable. I mentioned to the waitress I felt it was little rice on my order. And she when back and served me more at no cost. Glass water was refilled without asking and that to me is a big plus'b\"I sat on the patio for 10 minutes, at one of the tables clearly belonging to Toros, without being served.  A server walked right by me twice while waiting on the only other occupied table.  This is the second time I've left this restaurant for this reason.  Two tries in a year to eat here.  There won't be a third.\"b'This is my local Watering Hole to visit. The employees are wonderful and fun. Dusty really knows how to bring the energy to the bar. I have had a couple of food items and have enjoyed how they tasted.'b\"Used to come here it was excellent  not true anymore. The shrimp fajitas for $19 had 6 shrimp you needed glasses to see. They forgot our quesadilla and then brought it out wrong. I got up to ask for my own chips and then they charged 2.50 for Pico DE Gallo. Prices are too high for bad food and service to bad the old chef left. We won't be back\"b\"My wife and I went to Toros for dinner. It was very inviting - they had the football games on and it was lively and happy but not too crazy or loud. We ordered a couple tacos, chimichanga and churros. That we're all good , churros were the best. Also had dogfish 90 on tap!  The best about the whole dinner was the service. Rene took great care of us. She was nice, personable and made sure we had everything we needed.\"b\"So I'm writing this review after sitting here for 30 minutes with a menu in front of me and no one has bothered to even take our drink order. We are in plain site but no one even came to check on us. \\n\\nThey are not even busy at all. Several people came after us and got service but they ignored us - probably because we weren't a big party. \\n\\nSo after having time to consider their overpriced food I will go somewhere else and actively tell people not to go here. Before leaving I went in and told the wait staff we would be leaving because we didn't receive any service and they were hardly even concerned - read rude.\\n\\nAt least I got to eat a basket of their gross greasy chips for free. We won't be back here or to their equally overpriced and meagerly less than average sister restaurant John Cutter. If you want overpriced greasy bar food don't miss John Cutter!\"b'Not sure how it is when Dusty Lee is not here but when she is 5 stars! She makes everything better! So kind. great smile! And Dusty Lee makes everyone so welcomed !!!'b'Dusty is great. Always a funny story and the drinks are amazing. Get the protein bowl with chicken.'b\"Very sweet bartender! Didn't catch her name but she's blonde and Does ladies night every Tuesday and you get a free gift if you're a female. Love this place. It's very trendy inside and it's always a fun environment... Although I do wish they'd switch up their music once and a while. But regardless awesome place to hang.\"b\"Great food. Great staff!! Shawne Kelly gave me good luck!! Won a little money and had some great drinks!! Ask for Shawne next time your there! I went late so I'm guessing late shift is his.\",)</th>\n",

       "      <th>(b'I love when chain restaurants can still produce homemade tasting items and provide excellent service. Their seasonal breakfast items, iced coffees (with to go cups!), and friendly staff will have me coming back.'b\"We went here on 10/9/2012 and let me say please go to a different location. I had to send back two, yes two breakfast plates. The first breakfast meal was cold and loaded with grated cheese. I asked for extra chives and bacon but when I asked what happened, I was told that the restaurant was out of chives. I couldn't locate the extra bacon to save my life and never requested for extra cheese. The second breakfast requested was for the sirloin tips and eggs. We received a burnt up mess but at least the manager on duty was able to identify what is was on the plate. Now, lets get to the Spanish speaking in the back involving two employees complaining about another table bitching about their breakfast too. News flash...I speak,read and write in Spanish. Thank you very much. You never know who can and its just very unprofessional! So, I say that the cook(s) and servers should take a look at the pictures of how meals should look before sending it out. If it looks like crap...your customers will assume it taste like crap too! I'm so glad I took pictures of the meals and sent them along w my experience to the IHOP manager. Some additional training is needed.\"b\"Their sirloin tips are to die for - the best value tasty 'fast food dine in' meal to be had across this great country.\\n\\nFor the most part, the staff are excellent and the restrooms clean.   \\n\\nWe've been travelling the USA for 2 months, repeating our holiday of last year. Been coming to the US since '78 and had never been to IHOP until the last trip. I regret not trying the place decades ago, now I know what I have been 'passing up' - they leave the other fast food joints for dead.\"b\"Came here with some family who live locally for  some after-church breakfast recently. \\n\\nIHOP's are pretty much the same all over, so I won't go into detail on what was ordered, but what  is worth mentioning is the service.  It sucked.\\n\\nOur drinks took forever, it took way too long to place our order and it took even longer to get the food to the table. Apparently the waitress that we had that day was notorious for being sub-par. During a previous visit she had forgotten about the table all together. \\n\\nAt the end  of the day if you actually LIKE what  IHOP has to offer (mediocre food, atmosphere and service) than look no further. But should you happen to actually care about the the quality of  your experience, try the Omelet House.\"b\"I'm really surprised about the star rating as one person said it was very good food but only gave them 3 stars cuz it was IHOP. How is that fair??? \\n\\nMy daughter and I were seated immediately. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all so we got service very quick although it took us a little while to figure what we wanted. \\n\\nThis was the very best IHOP I've ever been to. The food looked just like the picture which was surprising since no restaurant's food looks like their pictures anywhere. I was so happy to see the pancakes so perfect. \\n\\nThere were only a few people working. One waiter, 1 Manager (I think that's what he was), and a cook. The restaurant was very clean, the server was polite and attentive and again, the food was perfect. \\n\\nHopefully, my visit was the norm because I do plan on returning for some more of those lightly browned pancakes!\\n\\nI really don't know what these other star raters are talking about. Maybe the stars were aligned and the pancake gods reigned down maple flavored fairy dust on me that day because the food was terrific and the staff did their jobs. \\n\\nIf you want some good IHOP food, Go here and get it!\"b\"Why oh why can't I get any consistency at restaurants! \\nOne day it's excellent the next not so much!!! Why!!!\\n\\nSo I go back to this IHOP because today is 60 cent stack of pancake day (http://ihopllc.fbmta.com/members/ViewMailing.aspx?MailingID=30064797049)\\n\\nI walk in and am immediately seated by a young lady who seemed like she was just there to do her job and would be so happy if it were the end of her shift. This was all subtle. \\n\\nWe are seated, and in less than what felt like maybe 2 minutes, little Ms. Jazmin came to get our drink order. As usual, I got water and my daughter decided to try their new Watermelon fizzy drink which she liked, btw. \\n\\nWhen she brings our drinks back we order 2 stacks each of the promotional pancakes. \\n\\nMeanwhile, a Hispanic couple comes in and is seated at the opposite end of the room from us. About 20 minutes later a couple of middle-aged women come in and our seated in the booth next to us. \\n\\nMy daughter comments that the Hispanic couple just received their order. Giving the situation the benefit of the doubt, I explain that maybe they put in their order before us. \\n\\nThen a few minutes later, the two middle-aged women received their food. I jumped out of that seat and with aggravation and disdain, asked them where in the hell are me and my daughter's pancakes. I told them that we have been waiting 30 minutes for pancakes while these other people have their food and our already eating. \\n\\nThe waitress grabs a plate of pancakes and says to me their coming right out so I go sit down but get right back up and ask for the Manager. I could see that the pancakes she grabbed were not actually ours since she was not on her way to our table. \\n\\nIn the end a young Hispanic guy around 20 yrs old came to our table and asked what happened and I explained and he said that we didn't have to pay for anything and asked did we want anything else from the menu. \\n\\nI won't lie...The pancakes were still very good. My daughter and I even took an order each of pancakes home. \\n\\nI never did get that business card Jazmin promised. \\n\\n2 stars for the free food, the apology and the pancakes to go.\\n\\nSide note: Everyone waiting tables and the hostess were all very young women. There were no authoritative figures anywhere in the restaurant. Management was not there.\\n\\nWHEN THE CAT'S AWAY, THE MOUSE WILL PLAY!!! THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY!\"b\"IHOP isn't bad, it's just not that good either.  I used to think IHOP was much better several years ago.  They still have good pancakes and French toast, but unfortunately I don't think they do well with most other dishes especially outside of breakfast.  The sausage seems like it was not cooked, but more like boiled or something.  Hashbrowns were also pretty good I guess, but generally I can get just as good or better at several other resturants.  Just seems like the overall quality of the food and service just isn't what it used to be.  I would actually rather go to even Denny's these days, whereas a few years ago I would have chosen IHOP first.  They seemed to remove several items off the menu that I loved.  This time around I didn't see any types of skillets on the menu which is dissapointing for me because that is one of my favorite breakfast options.  The quality of the food is down, and the price of the food is a bit high considering the lower quality.  Also just want to add a comment about the service.  We were seated in a corner and none of the servers noticed us for nearly 10 minutes.  Not exactly the best service, they should be able to do much better.\"b'Five stars because the food just tastes amazing. Must have a secret recipe for the funny face pancake.'b'Came in on a Sunday morning at 8am. Instantly sat in a booth. Our server was quick with our food and drinks. She was also on top of drink refills and checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Will be back'b'This is definitely our family go to when the kids are wanting breakfast for dinner. Very close to home &amp; always a fun time when meeting with family or friends for breakfast. Service has always been great.'b'You could here the servers in the back gossiping about people. Once the manager went in they all went back to work. Our server was good \"newbie\" \\nThe food was okish. My hashbrown was hard ontop and the eggs were more raw than med well. One bacon was hard close to burned while the other was cooked perfect. \\nI tried the berry crepe... I\\'d give it a 6 out ot 10\\nI\\'d rather have a pancake instead \\nOverall its an ordinary ihop nothing special. I\\'d rather go to a small family owed bf place.',)</th>\n",

The non-smoking section has a Strip view; the whole place feels very airy with lots of windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegan Report: Getting the bruschetta (without cheese) and the minestrone soup (without cheese) always makes me a happy lady.\"b\"The moment we got to Vegas last weekend, my friend insisted we go to this place.  I really wasn't in the mood for Italian food but the group wanted it, so I was out of luck.\\n\\nAfter a rather long wait for a non-buffet restaurant (20-25 min), we were seated.  We got the insalata caprese (although they didn't call it that), and the spinach and feta raviolio and manicotti and finished with the creme brulee.  The portions are rather large, so with a guy and 3 girls, the above menu was enough.\\n\\nThe prices were very fair, especially considering it was Vegas and that it was considered a very good restaurant.  The wine selection was decent.  If you're not in the mood to go bankrupt at Nobu, Lupo, or Postrio, go to Maggiano's for some very reasonable and altogether excellent Italian food in a great setting.\"b'I used to go here all the time after school!\\n(one of the many great perks of living in vegas.)\\nThe prices are decent and the servings are huge!!\\nTheir stuffed mushroom is superb!!\\nThis place is great for that little pick-me-up after a day of shopping at the Fashion Show mall! \\nTheir service is amazing too!'b'The food at Maggianos is absolutely superb. Knowing that Las Vegas has a rep for the ultra high end, Maggianos was the best I had.\\n\\nThe profiterole rolls were absolutely divine and the setting a little reminiscent of pastis in New York.'b\"The best Italian food I've had in Vegas and the best bruschetta I've ever had anywhere (admittedly I've not yet actually been to Italy though).  The menu options were original and everything we ordered was both extraordinarily flavorful and fresh.  We were there for lunch and the prices were a steal (for example, the $6 bruschetta was the size of a meal in itself and the wine by the glass was also reasonable by Vegas standards).  \\n\\nOur waiter was nothing special, but we wanted for nothing.  And while the dining experience for me is usually diminished when dining in a mall (even a Vegas mall), I found that the location was actually quite nice and lended itself to great views of the strip.  I would have liked to have tried the desserts but I hardly could finish my meal because of the large portions--I guess that means I'll have to go back.\"b'An average PF Chang, Cheesecake Factory quality chain restaurant located at the very fashionable Fashion Show Mall.  For Vegas, this might be 5-star but for me it is only 3.  Sorry.\\n\\nBring your appetite -- portions are buffet style.'b'Great atmosphere, great fresh food. The plates have just the right amount of flavor, even the \"heaviest\" dishes end up being pretty light. The prices are really good and accommodate every appetite since most plates are available in full and half size.\\nWe spent 4 days in Vegas and had dinner at the Maggiano\\'s twice!'b\"This place is sooooo yummy! I went for dinner and there was a little bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad. There's not much of a waiting area which sucks because it feels like you're always in the way. Once we were seated it was more of the same. The tables were very close together and people kept squeezing by our table which truly annoyed me. For that reason i had to remove one star. However everything else was superb! I had the lobster ravioli which was delicious. In fact I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it! I also had a Caramel apple martini which was delicious! I had to get another. By the end of the meal my belly was full and my body was tipsy. I'd say that's a perfect way to end the day! :-)\"b\"Maggiano's Little Italy is on the second floor of the Fashion Show Mall, across from the Wynn and Treasure Island on Las Vegas Blvd. \\n\\nMaggiano's is a chain restaurant that can be found in over 20 states. I have eaten at the one in Minneapolis as well as this one. I guess in the hiearchy of Italian food Chain restaurants it goes something like this:\\n\\nOut of the can and not Italian: Chef Boyardee\\nSlightly better Casual not Italian: Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill\\nA little better if you didn't know better: Pasta Pomodoro \\nMid-level trying to fool you as high-end Italian: Maggiano's and Buca de Beppo\\nHigher prices and more Northern Italian: Il Forniao\\nReally great Italian: don't tend to be chain restaurants \\n\\nMaggiano's has nice ambiance, expensive dark wood decor, and is usually very popular and crowded. In Vegas expect to wait even with a reservation. We had a party of 10, called at 5 and couldn't get reservation until 8:30. Maggiano's is perfect for large parties, as they offer huge dishes that are meant to be shared (most have a half size option, so take it!) They offer a family style approach special menu for large groups, where the cost is $29.95 per person, and includes 2 shared appetizers, 2 pastas, and 2 mains in a bottomless approach. They encourage this, as they will tell you if you order a la carte, it may take 30 - 45 minutes (for Pasta?). we went a la carte because some didn;t want to comprimise into limited selections. \\n\\nThe Mozzarella Buffula appetizer (what they called Tomato Slice and Mozzarella, or something like that) is one of my favorite Italian appetizers. The special goat mozzarella with a basil leaf over a tomato slice is a nice combination, Maggiano's shreds the basil, which I prefer the fresh whole leaf. You get 3 slices with an order. \\n\\nThe Capellini d'arrabiata (which they call by the English name of Angel Hair) comes in a huge bowl with about 1/2 to 1 pound of pasta, roma tomatoes, garlic and a little oil, with some basil, and a slightly spicey arrabiata sauce. They have a couple of lasagna offerings, either covered in a bolognese (ground beef) sauce or in a Marinara. It is huge, like everything is. There is a large menu of good selections for most people. \\n\\nThey don't offer olive oil and balsamic vinegar with your bread, but if you ask for it, they will bring it to you. \\n\\nIf you want A LOT of food and willing to pay over $30 per person for Pasta, go here.\"b\"I dined here on a Monday by myself at 6pm - it was busy but I was seated at a booth without hesitation.\\n\\nThe menu is vegetarian friendly - I chose to get the half-order of spaghetti with a mixture of marinara and white sauce. While waiting for my entree, I munched on the fresh bread that I dipped in olive oil - mmmmm!\\n\\nThe spaghetti was good - I would have finished it if hadn't eaten the bread.\\n\\nMy waitress was friendly, attentive and efficient.\\n\\nYeah, its a chain but for the price point and compared to what's around, you get not only a good deal but good food too.\"b\"Good Italian food although the hostess took forever to seat us. Our server was much better and the food was good. We got the chopped salad which was great and the pesto, chicken, pine nut linguine. It actually wasn't spectacular but it was much better later that night for dinner.\"b'I\\'ve seen Maggianos in other cities, but this was my first time dining at one.  We decided to have our meal \"family style\" which was recommend by my brother and his fiancee.   \\n\\nThe food was pretty good, in particular we enjoyed the mussels and loved  the Tiramisu.  Our server was excellent.  They also have some reasonably priced wines available.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard mixed things about this chain, but was pretty impressed with my visit.  Family style definitely seems to be the way to go when dining here.'b'Food: Food here was excellent. I had the chicken parmigiana which also came with a side of spaghetti or fettuccine . The spaghetti was delicious and the chicken was also very tasty and moist. Portions were huge,especially for lunch time!\\n\\nPrice: Prices are modercheap! why go to an expensive Italian place on the strip when you can dine here for half the price and get good quality food!\\n\\nAtmosphere: I liked dining here. It was quiet, relaxing and great for groups or family dining.\\n\\nService: Service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  Our water glasses were always refilled. \\n\\nLocation: Located in Fashion Show Mall on the second floor. Great to dine after/before shopping!'b'Please try the bruschetta. Really good and you can taste the fresh garlic. Very good service and the food is good.'b'We went here last Thursday around 7pm and goooooood loooooord was it a long wait for a table.  I was surprised this place was as packed as it was.  Definitely make a reservation..even on a Thursday!\\n\\nAside from that the food was decent.  The wife went for the lasagna after rave reviews from my 78 year old coworker who said it was the best he\\'d ever had.  It was ok.  A little too sausagey and I thought lasagna was supposed to have lasagna noodles in it???  I went with the calamari marinara/arrabiata or whatever which was pretty good...but Nora\\'s is better and $5 less.  \\n\\nPortions are huge here, its nice they offer half sizes but I would still opt for the \"regular\" portions since leftovers (ie 2nd meal) is worth having.    You could easily just split a salad and entree with another person and be full.  \\n\\nI still prefer Nora\\'s and Battista\\'s over this place but its not bad.  I give it 3.5'b\"I'm surprised this place has four stars, which I think is a little high if you're judging based on taste, but value for your money, this is definitely good value.\\n\\nI came here a couple nights ago with a very large group (about 14?). We showed up without notice, and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so. The table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course, but can have as much of those courses as you want until you're ready for the next one. We ordered calamari, caesar salad, another type of salad (I think it was the Maggiano's), tomato with mozarella, chicken parmesan, lasagna, spaghetti with marinara sauce, salmon, tiramisu, and cheesecake. The salads were decent - crisp, and tangy. The mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too 'pizza mozarella' tasting for me. The spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite, along with some of the other people at the table. It was light, and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness. The lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant, crumbly way. It wasn't chewy, cheesy, and meshing with the lasagna layers. \\n\\nThe cheesecake was really delicious, came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Mm!\\n\\nThe service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us, but it was fairly busy in the restaurant, so I can understand.\\n\\nI'd come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats, but I wouldn't come here for a date or a small intimate group meal.\"b\"Great Italian food. Could be a bit pricey for what you get at this restaurant. I ordered the lobster ravioli (which literally gives you like 8 pieces or something), and it was very good. \\n\\nI love pasta, and this place seems to cook it well. The bread isn't that bad here either. Great service too!\\n\\nI have been to the one in Santa Row in CA, and I feel that the vibe there is more elegant than this one (since this one is in the Fashion Mall). Bring your family here...\"b'I\\'m not the biggest fan of chain places mostly because the food lacks love and atmosphere seems fake.  But if there\\'s a chain place that does it right, it would have to be Maggiano\\'s.  The food feels like its been prepared with care and the place is comfortable without being too commercial.  And their Las Vegas location is no exception.\\n\\nThe Maggiano\\'s Salad and Chocolate Zuccotto Cake are a must try.\\n\\nWhat was particularly interesting for this visit was the wine I had.   I usually find it difficult to smell what I\\'m suppose to smell in red wine: hints of strawberries, cherries, oak, vanilla, leather, sunshine, earth, wind, fire, etc, whatever.  Not this time: I smelled the floral bouquet that was suppose to be in my red.  I was so shocked that I was practically snorting instead of drinking it.\\nThe only reason I stopped was I heard our waiter ask, \"Is everything okay, sir?\"  And as I looked up from my glass to answer, I saw the wife shaking her head with the \"What are you doing?\" look and the waiter slightly looming behind her with a smirk.\\nI placed my glass down and responded, \"We\\'re fine.  Thank you.\"\\nI should\\'ve responded with \"This wine may have gone sour.  Could you please bring me something else?\"  But then he would have taken the only wine I could smell properly.'b'We decided to stop here and have lunch. Boy am I glad that we did! Maggiano\\'s was delicious!! I really regret not taking pictures of our food but I was enjoying it so much that I was too busy stuffing my face and didn\\'t think to pull out the camera. \\n\\nI\\'m a total soup girl, so after hearing the day\\'s selection of soups, I decided on a cup of roasted mushroom soup. When it arrived my jaw dropped. I asked for a cup (or small ...whatever) and it arrived in a huge bowl!! The portions were huge! I even waited and double checked with our server that they didn\\'t make a mistake and give me the bigger size bowl of soup and she said \"nope, that\\'s the small one\". Well, the soup was delicious. It was full of mushrooms in a cream base and was sooooo yummyyy!!!  My mom ordered the \"small\" Spinach Salad and that was delicious as well. Never had roasted red peppers in a spinach salad and it surprisingly gave great flavor with the smoked bacon, crumbled gorgonzola, sweet onions and toasted pine nuts. We would have been just fine with our soup and salad but little did we know that the portions were going to be so huge!\\n\\nOkay, entree time...we both went with sandwhiches. I had the Jumbo Lump Crabcake Sandwhich (via their menu on the website...\"Crab cake on a brioche bun with arugula, tomato and crispy onion strings and mustard mayonnaise. Served with parmesan chips\") and my mom had the Seared Salmon Sandwhich (which is not listed on the menu online for some odd reason). THOSE WERE THE 2 BEST DAMN SANDWHICHES I\\'VE EVER HAD!!!! OMGGGG!! Sooo yummyyyy!!! I think it\\'s funny that we were at an Italian restaurant and didn\\'t have pasta but I am so glad at our choices because the food was soooo delicious!\\n\\nWe were so stuffed from our soup and salad that we each only ate half of our sandwhiches and went back to our hotel room with our leftovers, happily! LOL! We were very happy with our lunch from Maggiano\\'s and will be making it a regular stop on future visits to Vegas.\\n\\nAlthough I am in the Bay and heard there\\'s a Maggiano\\'s down in San Jose, I rarely head down to the South Bay so I doubt I\\'ll be visiting that one. I highly suggest the location in Las Vegas!! \\n\\np.s. Excellent service as well! Oh yeah, and it was a lovely day so we opted to dine outside and it was very nice! The weather was perfect!'b\"I'm not big on chain restaurants but Maggiano's is my fav italian spot!  I've never had a bad experience at the Woodland Hills location in CA and LV did not disappoint. The food is always great and so is the service.  I've tried a lot of the appies and my favs are the calamari, stuffed mushrooms and the shrimp oreganata! AWESOME!  I love the four cheese ravioli with the pesto alfredo.  As Rachel says...YUM-O!  The maggiano's chopped salad is also great.  \\n\\nThis place all in all is great for groups or even a nice dinner with BF.  Keep it up Maggiano's!\"b\"I love this place. I came here with a large group and we were served family style with so many delicious entrees but this place had already won me over before the food came.The restaurant has a glass wall and if you sit in the right corner you can see the fashion show mall, wynn las vegas, and even down the north end of the strip. I loved watching the Wynn sign change colors and move as I ate and enjoyed great cocktails. The food was authentic Italian food and vey filling. Delicious. We had a ravioli that was too die for. A lemon chicken with capers, I think. There was also like a lasagna or something. I don't know but everything was good and just really above average. The girl sitting next to me hated seafood and wouldn't try a few things so she kept complaining but seriously grow up and eat some damn fish! This place is great. The atmosphere is homey and a little cheesy with Italian music playing. The lighting was dark and the table cloths where red and white checkered. I loved everything about this restaurant!\"b'The food was great.  The wait staff was impeccable.  My favorite part of the meal is the hunk of Parmesan cheese they give you.  yummy!  I also enjoyed the grappa they hand you at the end of the evening.'b\"This Maggiano's, like all the others, is what it is....but a little bit better given the excellent viewpoint from the fashion show mall out onto the strip.  Went here with 12 people and had wonderful time despite the mediocre food.  Like all chains, the menu is formulaic and there are hits and misses.  \\n\\nHits include the super garlicy Shrimp Oreganata, Garlic Shrimp Linguine, and Lobster Ravioli.  Needless to say, they do garlic right.  The tiramisu was also quite tasty and enormous (not that this matters much since Maggiano's is all you can eat)\\n\\nMisses included a mediocre (actually pretty bad) gnocchi, oily and limp Eggplant Parmesan, and cheesecake that was heavy and flavorless.\\n\\nI last went t this Maggiano's back in 2005 and can't say I'd recommend it for 'fine dining,' but in terms of bang-for-your-buck in Las Vegas it is certainly a valid option.\\n\\n2 Stars for the food, 4 for a good time atomsphere with a big group.  Its closer to a 2.5 than a 3, but I'll round up for good memories.\"b\"Solid 4.  I have been to three Maggiano's (2 in CA and now Vegas).  The one in Vegas is the best one.  This is my favorite place to eat Italian food.  The food is great.  They have large portions.  Service was quick and polite.  Always try to go to a Maggiano's on the off hours or make a reservation to avoid long waits.  My favorites are the chicken parm and garlic shrimp pasta.\"b\"Despite my previous experiences with Maggiano's in San Jose, I particularly enjoyed my Maggiano's experience in Las Vegas.  The bar here was just as high as my first experience back in San Jose.  We were here for my buddy's birthday and we had well over twenty people with us.  The staff pulled out all the stops to make sure we were well taken care of.  The food was like a flowing river of endless plates and our waiters did an excellent job of keeping us entertained.  Since Las Vegas has been a regular stop for my friends and I as of late, I would definitely come back here to re-live the experience.  Food recommendations: Everything!\"b'4stars-1star\\n4stars for the food. I Love Maggiano\\'s. Their baked four cheese raviolis in creamy pesto sauce could not be more ah-mazing.Buyer beware, the half order is more than enough to fill you up! And another fair warning: the mama\\'s lasagna could probably feed a family of five. Ok, if you have a huge appetite, maybe a family of three.\\n1star for the server. The SERVICE was great. We were seated quickly, the food came out quickly, had a great table with a view of the outside of Fashion Show Mall. But our server really...screwed up? He asked us where we were from and we responded \"California\" and he proceeded to tell us what bad drivers we are...umm does he know we are the ones who tip him? Regardless us this gentleman\\'s faux pas I still tipped him 20%. Hopefully he\\'ll learn to keep his big mouth shut next time he gets one of us crazy Californian drivers.'b'Much better experience than the Santana Row, San Jose, CA location.\\nThe servers, staff, food were excellent. \\nEveryone was polite. The location was much nicer and more central to the strip. We had a great time. We had a nice family dinner and enjoyed every aspect.'b\"I usually like Maggiano's, especially when I come with a big group. \\n\\nThe view from this location is great, because it's right above the Strip, so you can see everything around the Wynn, which is right across the street. \\n\\nThe host staff was polite, the food was quick, but our server was NONE OF THE ABOVE! He basically did everything short of rolling his eyes at us. \\n\\nWhat a mood killer. And meal killer. And Maggiano's killer.\"b'So i pass by maggianos every time I visit southcoast in CALI which is almost weekly but I had never tried their food.  So when we were in vegas for my birthday we decided to head their for our lunch before we headed back to Cali.   We ordered our meal after awhile because the server was being erratic and then after twenty minutes or so we got our appetizer.  After we recieved it they asked us to move to another table towards the middle and we had to carry our own food and dishes over.  Then after another twenty minutes or so we received our food.  Too bad when we said \"no marinera\\' on my besties pasta and confirmed that we are sorry but to please substitute and she glady said it was no problem it of course came out with marinera.  However it took so long in the first place for our food to arrive so my bestie stuck to it.  THEN what happened is unbelievable..they actually started VACUUMING right behind us.  Back and Forth Back and Forth with NO warning what-so-ever which I don\\'t even know if it would have made it any better.  After 5-10 minutes...YES SERIOUSLY the couple behind us asked to get the check because they couldn\\'t stand it.  After the whole ordeal our server comes out as if she just realized the vacuum had been on and asks if we want to move.... NO IDIOT THE DUST ALREADY FLEW UP AND LANDED SAFELY ON MY FOOD. I DONT WANT TO EAT NOW I WANT TO GET OUT... \\n\\napparently they had their carpet cleaned and they needed to vacuum the moisture out....As if that could not wait until another time????\\n\\nwhat a dissappointment.  So I asked her for their card so I could leave corporate a comment.  I didn\\'t get to it until a month or so later and they said it was too late to leave a comment but too bad I still did.  After my comment I didn\\'t receive any notice that they received my comment.  I am NOT looking for free comps or anything of that nature I just want them to understand that is NOT what I expected in a restuarant...it reminded me of those annoying sweepers in cafeterias/fastfood joints.  \\n\\nThis location needs HELP'b\"there's so much to say about it this place i dont know how to start ,,first our reservation was for 830,,we got seated at 830 but didnt  get to order till 10pm(seriously)an hour and a half for our server to take our order..then we got our food at 1100(btw theres 9 in our party)..my sis lambchops were past well done,(she asked for medium rare!!!),i ordered lobster fettucine w/ no peas and artichokes....what did i get??lobster fettucine with peas and artichokes!!!!my sis got her garlic mashed potatoes after she's almost done with chewing her very chewy lambchops..the rest of the food was well,,okay,,not great for what youre paying for...by the end of the night our bill totaled to almost $500.00...$80.00 of it Is gratuity for our server who we saw twice...\\n\\nIM NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS PLACE.....\\n\\nIF YOU WANT ITALIAN FOOD,,,YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO TO MACARONI GRILL,,WAY MUCH BETTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE.....\"b\"i LOVE LOVE LOVE Maggiano's. I've been to three of their locations, and most recently the Las Vegas one again.\\n\\nMy bf and I arrived around 8 on a Saturday night, and thankfully only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I had been starving myself since the morning in anticipation of this meal. We took the first available, which was outside and I wouldn't recommend it. It's not Maggiano's fault, but there was an iPod commercial running on a continuous loop on one of the outdoor televisions at the mall. Even with the ambient noise, and the restaurant's own music, by the time we were done with dinner, I was ready to jab a fork in both of my ears. That being said, I still had a great dinner! \\n\\nI've never been disappointed with the food nor service, and this time was no different. Our waiter was very nice and attentive and helped us pick out a really good bottle of wine.  We started with the fried mozzarella with marinara sauce... yummm.  The Maggiano salad has a great light flavored dressing and little bits of prosciutto in it.... so tasty! And for the main course we shared my favorite dish on the face of this planet, the chicken and spinach manicotti. Words just cannot do this dish justice, suffice it to say it's freakin fabulous. \\n\\nI somehow mustered the courage to order desert, even though my stomach was filled to the max. But I just absolutely love their cheesecake. I am NOT a big fan of cheesecake, but Maggiano's makes theirs with mostly marscapone cheese and it is just wonderful! \\n\\nSo if you are in Vegas and looking for some overly generous portioned great food I highly recommend Maggianos!\"b\"my first time at maggianos overall..and it did not disappoint.  had such a great window seat, where you could see wynn and people busying around down below, since the maggiano's was in the 2nd floor of the building.  \\ni think this particular location would be great for lunch, or anytime the sun is out because the sun shines through the big open windows.\\nordered 4 big pasta dishes (to share with four other people of course, but i would be down to eat all that), have to rave about the Rigatoni'D!! the sauce...made it what it is. a pesto, white creamy sauce sooo good, i definitely recommend it to everybody.  our waiter, i forget the name, was awesome..he had this cool accent and was so nice and helpful. the calamari was OK but ..the cheesecake was pretty good.\"b\"I love Maggiano's!! It is great for big parties. My family and I are a huge fan of the Family Style Lunch. \\n\\nhttp://www.maggianos.com/foodbeverage/default.asp?menu=Family%20Style%20Lunch\\n\\nYou get two choices of appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. They also refill the plates. So if you finish your appetizer, they'll give you another one and if you don't finish it they let you box it up. \\n\\nMy favorites are the Calamari Fritte, Stuffed Mushrooms and the Tiramisu!!!\\n\\nEveryone in the world needs to celebrate one event in their life at Maggiano's. It is totally worth the price.\"b\"Went here for dinner - just me and the hubby.  Every time we come out to Vegas we come here.  Great place, love the food, scenery was very nice and italian of course.  Waiters was great.  Very little wait time.  If you never been there before and don't know where to park it can be tricky or you will be walking for a while before you get there.\\nHubby and I had a great romantic time.  Been going there since 2003, every visit to vegas we always make sure we stop here.\\nThis is great mouth watering italian food.  My fav dish is the Rigatoni 'D' &amp;\\nWe love the calamari!!\"b\"This is another place that I've only experience for Happy Hour.  I would have given the place a 5 if they hadn't taken the pizzas off the HH menu.   They were so good, the other items like the crispy onions, the mozarella sticks, etc. were still fabulous.  They usually have drink specials as well, like deals on Pink Vodka martinis.  Depending on the day, there is also a piano player in the lounge/bar area.\"b\"What a let down Maggiano's ended up to be. My first experience ended up being a horrible one. \\n\\nCome on now, you do not vacuum your carpet when you have guests who are eating!! Making us move to another table just so you can vacuum does not make it any better! I think I might have ate some of the dust. \\n\\nBesides that whole ordeal, the calamari was the best I ever had here. THE BEST! I ordered a chicken dish which was blah. KFC prepares better chicken. Its my fault though, ordering chicken at a Italian restaurant is like eating sushi at a buffet in Vegas, IT SUCKS!\"b'The rave reviews surprise me.  Saltiest food ever.  I could barely eat the eggplant parm, which is usually a favorite of mine.  I was thirsty for an entire day after...I thought I was going to need an IV to replenish my fluids!'b\"so f-ing good! came here for dinner with some friends. we were seated right away. service was great. the food was yummy. i had the lobster fetticine and that shit was the bomb! the ambiance of the restaurant was very nice too. very elegant. you didn't even feel like you were in vegas. best of all it was affordable and not as expensive as you would expect compared to other restaurants in vegas.\"b\"This is my favorite restaurant. I love to eat here with my family for birthdays and such.\\nThey have some of the best Italian food I have ever tasted. There's really good spaghetti, Fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli (my favorite with or without greens), and chicken Parmesan. They also have this stuff called onion strings (like a small, classy plate of mini, entangled onion rings) that is cravable, especially with the creamy, lemonish sauce. You have to ask for it on the side, though, or you may not get it.\\nThe atmosphere is really nice, too, especially if you're in the room surrounded by windows (unless someone suicidal brought a pet rock as their date).\\nThey give you a dessert on your birthday. They used to be lemon cookies, but I think they changed it to cake. I don't particularly like the desserts, but my family LOVES those lemon cookies!\\nOverall, this is one of the best Italian places. Period.\"b\"Tony B-\\n\\nI just want to set the record straight.  Maggiano's is owned by a private company that was started in 1991 which also owns On the Border, Macaroni Grill, and Chili's. Maggiano's Restaurant has had the same owner since 1996. There has been no ownership change. If you had a bad experience, Maggiano's thrive's on customer satisfaction and will make sure that your next experience is a happy and memorable one. Thanks and don't forget to mention this article and mention the banquet sales department when you return!!\\n\\nStephany\\nLas Vegas\"b\"Service:  3.5 Stars\\n\\nAttentive.  Cordial.  Tapped out our drinks.  Made sure we were fine and dandy like a jovial Dean Martin singing that Mambo Italiano song.  Oh wait, this song WAS played during our meal on 3.20.09.  I'm sure it loops every day though.\\n\\nDecor:  3.5 Stars\\n\\nFancier than Macaroni Grill and I should hope so as this is Vegas and a step above its sister restaurant.  The seating was vast and it could probably fit at least 5 bachelorette parties.  Oh yeaaahh...  bachelorette parties...   *droool*  There weren't too many people let alone bachelorette parties, but most patrons were enjoying the beautiful weather in their outdoor seating area.\\n\\nFood:  3 Stars\\n\\nThe minestrone was ok.  It was a bit cheesy and the color seemed paler (not as tomato-red) and its taste was different than most minestrone soups I've had.  \\n\\nI had the Lobster Fettuccine.  There wasn't much lobster.  Italian Sausages were also few and a bit burnt.  The peas and artichokes gave it a nice balance.  The white wine cream sauce was really good but a little salty than I like my pasta sauces to be.  So this Little Italy Favorite is a mainstay in San Francisco fare?  I'm glad I had the chance to savor it in Vegas.\\n\\nI'd come back.  I'd probably go someplace closer though, like Orange County and go all out Family Style.  \\n\\nP.S. - To the previous Yelpers, I agree that the food made me thirsty; however, this place isn't as salty as their cousin On The Border in Rancho Cucamonga.\\n\\nP.P.S. - Update 3/26.  I just read an article in Yahoo Health today:  http://health.yahoo.com/experts/eatthis/26542/americas-unhealthiest-restaurants.  Chili's, On the Border, and Macaroni Grill - all owned by Maggiano's parent company, Brinker are on the hit list and the sodium count on their menu items aren't benefiting my pre-hypertension.\"b\"I have been here twice in the last year and both times were amazing. I went with my wife both times and we requested a table with a view, and when we got there we sat right in the corner and we were able to see all the people walking the strip and the cool Wynn sign. The place is huge so it is a great place for large parties as well. If you don't want to take a lot of food home (or back to the hotel room) then just order the 1/2 orders instead and even though it still may be tons of food at least you wont be wasting it. All the drinks are wonderful and the food is great every time we come here. Sure its just like any other Maggianos as far as taste goes but its Vegas so there is a little added something. I talk to the GM of this restaurant like once a month and he is a really nice guy. The staff is great and the views are amazing. If you have not been here..go and if you have been here ...go back. \\n\\nPeace Out, \\nMZ\"b'I was there for my birthday, and a couple of us had our birthdays on the same day or weekend, so we thought it\\'d be cool have our b-day dinner there. \\n\\nThe food was good. I forgot what I had (No, I wasn\\'t drunk...wait...was I?) but I know it was good and they give good, hearty portions. \\n\\nThe negatives were how crammed-up the dining area is. I mean, if you\\'re claustrophobic, then this ain\\'t the place for you. You can damn near eat off the next table if you\\'re slick enough. \\n\\nThe other issue I had was the 2 serenading musicians. Now, they probably didn\\'t mean any harm but after coming to our table, one of them noticed we were all Black and said \"I don\\'t know any rap but I take requests\" - Wow. Did he REALLY just go there? I had to put him in check and told him to keep it movin\\' before I show him what Gangsta Rap LOOKS like when a violin becomes a weapon. Needless to say...he quickly got out of there. \\n\\nThen they misplaced the birthday cake, but later found it...then lost the top that goes over it...then later found it. Yeah, it was one of those nights. \\n\\nBut the food was good. Maybe a tad bit overrated for the price though, especially in a food-ladened city like Vegas.'b\"Visiting Maggianos was one of the best experiences I had in Vegas.  We found it on Yelp from the glowing reviews and they pretty much all held true.  The service was friendly, the food was ENORMOUS and subtle in flavor.  We vacuumed up everything.  The wine was fine and they served us hot bread rolls with olive oil and balsamic vinegar before our appetizers.  All in all a way classy italian place for EXTREMELY cheap.  I couldn't believe I had such a delicious meal in an elegant environment AND wine for only $20!  Highly recommended.\"b\"It hasn't been scientifically proven; but Maggiano's may be the leading contributor to obesity in the United States. Good lord this place serves a ton of food.\\nIt was odd that I asked the waiter how big the baked zitti was off the lunch menu. He did his best to talk me out of it by saying that it was small and not that big (a half portion as he put it). This thing was huge! Full of fresh sausage, heavy sauce and noodles that could have fed three people instead of just one. We ended up getting our meal comped by the manager after a mix-up with the bill which was great and Ill definitely return when Im in town again.\\nGreat view too if you get a table near the glass.\"b\"I've only been here once and man i don't know how i never been here before.  It's a very nicely decorated restaurant that feels pretty fancy but it actually isn't that expensive.  We had a large group that got the family style dinner.  It was fantastic! everything was delicious and we were able to take home boxes of left overs.  it was like a buffet that was brought over to you.  large portions so you'll definitely get your moneys worth!  bring your eatin pants\"b'WOW! Strangely I live fairly close to a Maggianos and yet it took a trip to Vegas for me to try it out. What the heck took me so long???!!! This place is so yummy!! Our large group decided to get family style dinner. Salads were great, pastas were amazing! We got a salmon dish that was so good. There was a roasted chicken which was slightly dry, but that was the worst of it. \\nService was great and our waitress was right on top of everything! \\nWe even got to take home the leftovers....mmmm'b'Quality ingredients = good food. Chicken Francese is the bomb! ...Also sausage &amp; peppers appetizer was really good. ...Cool location is directly across from Wynn.'b'A great place to visit if you are sick of the hotel buffets! The atmosphere was nice and cozy. We came in on a Saturday night and our option was to wait 4 minutes or sit at the bar for dinner. We sat at the bar! The food was great, huge portions! We figured out after the fact that they specialize in family portions. I ordered the half order of lobster ravioli and it was delicious! Five huge raviolis stuffed with big chunks of lobster and a great sauce! The portion of sauce was just right, it was not drowning in it! My friend ordered the Caesar salad and when they brought it out we actually started laughing because it was so huge! He managed to eat the whole thing though! As for drinks I had the watermelon martini and he had the classic martini...both were great! I would definitely visit again...'b'The pasta for the price at Maggiano\\'s just can\\'t be beat!  I went with my Mom and her sister and my bf (Chris L.) last week while in Vegas.  I shared the gnocchi and meat lasagna with Chris L. and my Mom and aunt shared the corn pasta with shrimp.  The corn pasta was a must for them because they are both on a gluten-free diet so regular wheat pasta just doesn\\'t cut it.  I love that a serious Italian restaurant cares about the wheat-free side of life and offers wheat-free options.  I also love that a serious Italian restaurant can taste this good and not break the bank.\\n\\nThe wine list is great and the desserts were pretty good--I got the profiterole with ice cream and chocolate sauce and the dessert would\\'ve been divine if it weren\\'t for the profiterole....  The two baby boomers at the table each got the (GF) creme brulee and loved it.\\n\\nSo, for what Maggiano\\'s is, I\\'m giving it 5 stars.  It certainly beats the other \"cheap\" food of Vegas and the price is so much better than the expensive restaurants there.  That\\'s a win-win in my book.'b\"Very nice restaurant. I was trying to stay away from buffets and this place was conveniently located across the street from our hotel. The host and waitress, not so nice, but the food made up for it. I had to change the time of the reservation time once because we were running late and I guess she didn't like that. The waitress took our order and forgot about us for a while. \\nThe food was really good, it had a really good taste. It comes in really big portions so you can share or just take the rest home. \\nPrices are reasonable.\"b'off to Maggiano\\'s with a party of thirteen.\\nA very comfortable setting, so it seem.\\njust a little bit too dim...\\nwhich makes a perfect place for a date for her and him,\\nbut an even more perfect for a family dinner.\\nas we waited to be seated, we got hungrier and hungrier.\\nwe were then told that with parties bigger than eight,\\nwe must do family style even if we each want our own plate.\\nwe talked to the waiter who spoke with the manager,\\nbecause of misunderstanding, our own dish... we were able to order.\\nwe had 2 vegetarians in our party,\\nso the chef actually came and took their orders personally!\\ni ordered the clam pasta with red sauce,\\nit was a big portion, even when it is a \"half\" course.\\nso i split my meal with a friend.\\nthe dish was so delicious, we finished til the very end.\\nour glasses of water were never empty,\\nfor the waiter always refills it every minute oh so gracefully.\\nthe accordion player in the restaurant was very sweet and nice\\na friend spoke with him for a bit and he played her a song without thinking twice\\nwe were also celebrating our friend\\'s birthday,\\nanother song he played for her and must i say,\\nit was very very lovely...\\na great environment for a birthday party.\\nthe price was decent for the big portion of meal,\\ni have to say, it is a very good deal.'b'I had never been here, but we were doing a combo bachelorette/birthday and this place was awesome.  One waitress was pissed because we were taking a lot of pictures and standing in her way!  OOOOHHHH I\\'m SCARED - she kept giving us mean looks but WHATEVS.  Getting a group of females together to decided on 2 entrees, 2 salads, 2 apps is like filing your nails down a chalkboard.  Someone has to take control!  I ordered a Reisling and sat back to watch the fireworks show.  With large parties, the restaurant STRONGLY \"suggests\" ok forces you to have family style, which is FINE by me.  It actually works to your advantage because then you aren\\'t squabling over the damn check.  Of course we had one in our party that was a squabbler and a little bit of a pouty puss and was mad when she didn\\'t get her own way.  Well OKAYYYYYY.  So we finally decided on the chopped salad and spiniach salad and the bride is Jewish so we asked for bacon/pork on the side, which was no problem.  The brushetti was awesome, the bread great and the spinach dip was ok, kinda like the frozen kind, just ok.  The ravioli was great!  The waiter even brought me and another girl a sample (large sample) of the pesto with chicken and it was my FAV - we both wanted to order it for the entree, but because of the family style, we couldn\\'t.  Two people wanted to order off the ala carte menu, which they said was fine, as long as at least 6 wanted family style - that built in gratuity is a blessing because at the end of the meal, which was $22.50 per person, I ended up putting in $35 which covered my dinner, wine, tax and tip - couldn\\'t beat it with a stick.  The food is 10000000000 times better than stinky old Buca di Pepto Bismal!!  I highly recommend this place and I\\'m a picky eater.  LOVE IT'b\"I was craving pasta for dinner after the crap I ate at Todd English's Olives, so we wandered over from the Wynn and found this place. Stuffed mushrooms were amazing! The spinach salad was really good and the lobster ravioli was good. It had big chunks of lobster in it, but the cream sauce could have been better.. still yummy though.\"b\"My wife and I come to Las Vegas twice or three times a year and always grab a cocktail or two at Maggiano's.\\n\\ni am really glad to see that the owner realized to re-implement the best happy hour on the Las Vegas strip. For some reason they decided to stop this in May. But given the state of the economy, this was the best thing Maggiano's could do.\\n\\nI will always continue to come here and recommend it to my friends.\\n\\nKeep doing what you are doing.\"b\"This was probably the best meal of my trip.  We got there a little late in the evening so there was no wait, which is always nice.  Their portions are HUGE and you get a really good deal for what you pay for.\\n\\nWe got the sampler platter which is enough food by itself for three people.  We had a salad and soup and some other dish and everything was great.  The staff waited on us hand and foot and we had the most adorable waiter too!\\n\\nWhat a nice surprise to find in the Fashion Mall.  I will be back here the next time that I'm in Vegas.  Why spend tons of money in the hotels when this place is far better!!!\"b'calamari = bomb\\nstuffed mushrooms = bomb\\nveal parmesan = solid\\nlasagna = pretty interesting taste... has an italian sausage kick to it\\nwaiter was cool and made good suggestions as well'b\"This place is located upstairs in the front outside part of the Fashion Show mall on the strip.  If your driving park on the north side of the mall in the underground parking.  This place was packed with people, yet we still got seated very quickly.  The waiter was very pleasant and helpful.  We ordered a linguine with white clam sauce (very good:), the bracciola (ok), Maggiano's Salad (yummy), and Chicken Marsala (good, but I prefer cheesecake factory's...I know, I know, don't yell at me!)  The prices were very reasonable, and the complimentary bread was oh so yummy with the olive oil and vinegar!\"b'Great food and great service.  What more do you want?'b\"I was pleasantly surprised by a trip to Maggiano's a little over a month ago during a visit to Las Vegas.  I normally avoid chains, but this one is worth visiting again.\\n\\nThe appetizers were all very good (we went during happy hour).  The main courses were huge and moderately priced.  The service was very fast without bring rushed and our waitress was friendly.\\n\\nThe location is convenient on the front of the Fashion Show Mall.  Easy access from The Wynn, which is where I was staying.  Plenty of on-site parking as the mall has every parking option under the sun.\"b\"We sat outside. View was very nice. \\n\\nFood portions are HUGE. A half order is enough for one person. A full order is for people who want to share. \\n\\nI ordered a special, Chianti Beef, it was a little salty for my taste but my brother said it was great. I tasted some of his Garlic Shrimp Linguine, which was good but the noodles lacked flavor. I also tasted some of my mom's Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta which was the best in my opinion. It was full of flavor, but not too much. My family did critcize that the noodles were a little overcooked though, but I found it perfect. i guess it depends on your preference and how you like your noodles. Now i saved the best for last, I would honestly go to Maggiano's just for their garlic mashed potatoes. \\n\\nI have ever only really tasted two chef's mashed potatoes that i liked previous to this dish, but this is definitely in my top 2. It's hard to describe, but you just have to taste it. It's the perfect blend of ingredients, not too salty, good consistency, just try it! I'd seriously go all the way to San Jose from SF just to eat the mashed potatoes. \\n\\nFood took a little long to be prepared. Service was pretty good. Our waters got refilled, but nothing extremely special or eyecatching.\"b\"Heard this location is under new management and is experiencing some issues. My last visit was last October, so this review will be based on that experience. \\n\\nMaggiano's is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Why? Because it's great food, healthy portions, and outstanding value for what you get. I always leave satisfied and the service has always been wonderful. Visited the Santa Ana, CA, Chevy Chase, MD, and Tyson's Corner, VA locations - all the BOMB! \\n\\nMy favorites: \\n\\nRigatoni 'D' \\nChicken Parmesan - I order this with a side of pasta and meat sauce since the chicken parm does not come with it \\nApple Crostada \\nPeach Bellini - Now you know I have to have a cocktail with dinner! \\n\\nI've also sampled the spaghetti which is also pretty good. Honestly, I've had better though. \\n\\nMaggiano's is one of the last locations on the strip that offers a classy upscale atmosphere without the pretentiousness and is extremely affordable and family friendly.\\n\\nI highly recommend Maggiano's.\"b\"For the money you can't go wrong. The food is fresh and tastes like Italian food. No fusion nonsense here. All dishes hot and tasty. Service good. A popular spot for locals and tourists. You can't go wrong for chain Italian.\"b\"After a long day and nite of work, headed to Maggiano's for a late nite supper.  Small side salad...GOOD...Spaghetti w/ marinara...GOOD...Portions...HUGE...\\n\\nWaiter was really nice too, even though we came late and stayed late.\"b\"This place is great for a chain restaurant. I have not found many Italian restaurants I like, and my husband is very picky when it comes to Italian food. The service is great and the food is always reliably good. I lived in Vegas for almost 3 years and visited Maggianos at least 15 or 20 times and was never disappointed. We went as a large group with about 25 people when our friends from Boston were all out visiting, and decided to order family style. This was probably not necessary as most of the food went to waste because there was just too much of it. The portions are huge and I usually split a salad app and meal with my husband which is just enough for the both of us with room for dessert (you have to try the profiteroles!)  It's a great place to stop in for dinner before heading over to the Wynn, Encore, Palazzo or Venetian. The view isn't the best, and you usually have to wait 15-20 minutes with a reservation on a Friday or Sat night after 7pm, but compared to other places that isn't bad at all. If there is a Maggianos close to where you live then I would check out all the other places Vegas has to offer, but if not it is a good place to dine.\"b'There is no other Italian place (in my opinion) in Las Vegas.  I have been coming here for years every time I come to Vegas.  The only way to do it is family style - you get so much food, and they take such good care of you.  The only problem I have is I eat to much - every time I go and the rest of the night is miserable ... I never learn!! hahah'b\"Ate here last night and really enjoyed the food. I tried the crab cakes, which I really enjoyed even though I'm not a big fan of seafood. I had the Chicken and spinach stuffed Manicotti and loved it. The bathrooms were pretty dirty but it was late at night when we went. The service was good and we had a really good time there.\"b\"Some places wow you with their style and exotic cuisine, others sneak up on you with a little more subtlety. Maggiano's was one of my favorite meals in Las Vegas, because they just made everything easy. First of all, being in a non-smoking restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. We got to curl up in a cozy booth facing floor to ceiling windows so it was an entirely different vibe from most casino restaurants. \\n\\nIt is a chain, but it meant they offered a wide variety of reasonably priced options and our lunch entrees, Chicken Pesto Linguine and Chicken Francese ($11 - 13), were excellent. One of my favorite things to eat in Italy is a fresh arugula salad lightly tossed with oil, but it is hard to find in the U.S. I was thrilled when it came as a side to the Chicken Francese and it brought back so many wonderful memories. \\n\\nFrom our arrival through the end of service, the staff was professional, prompt and courteous. Portion size was hearty, especially the pasta dish, so we even skipped dinner that night. Not the most exciting choice in town, but sometimes you just want a little comfort food and air, sweet, sweet fresh air.\"b'For my mother-in-law\\'s birthday last weekend, my husband planned a big surprise birthday party for her at Maggiano\\'s, which is an old favorite haunt of his.\\n\\nMaggiano\\'s exterior is nothing spectacular considering they\\'re stuck on the second floor of a mall, but once you step out of the elevator you\\'re transported.  Giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood.  The bar area is dark paneled, well-staffed, and tucked far in the busy back / main dining room.  It was packed when we arrived, but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily (though we heard there was a one-hour wait for tables for those without reservations).\\n\\nWhen our table for 10 was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered.  It wasn\\'t particularly easy to navigate the space in which they\\'d placed our party, as they\\'ve crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths. However, the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet / battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs (or they just went around the other way).\\n\\nThe ambiance inside Maggiano\\'s was so dark, warm, and cozy that I was expecting more from the food.  The calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring, bland, and uninspired.  The spinach salad I ordered was GIANT and tasty; however, I wished I\\'d stopped there.  Unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre, and the bread on the tables was stale/hard.  It was so loud and busy in the restaurant (and I was drunk, which I\\'ll get to in a minute) that I didn\\'t even think to ask to try GT\\'s entree (linguini and clams in red sauce) which he said was a good thing, because he hated it (and said that the food was much better a few years ago).\\n\\nThe adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch; he played some of our requests at one end of the table (although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldn\\'t hear).  Throughout our meal I was shocked that I wasn\\'t drinking my wine; every time I turned to look at my glass I could swear it looked as if I hadn\\'t touched it.\\n\\nTurns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off, which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly, and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with GT\\'s uncle (who\\'d flown in from Oahu for the occasion) about whether or not boys are hornier than girls.  BAD, SELF, BAD!  Perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if she\\'d like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner.\\n\\nMy main gripe, however, was that GT and I had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out \"OH, SHIT, SHE\\'S 70!\" when all lined up properly.  But we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan we\\'d brought them in (though we\\'d asked that they be put on a large plate).  As a result, they read \"OHSH   ITSH  ES70!\"  Also, although the kind/patient waiter did light the candles for us, I got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end, or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert.  Regardless of the reason, I thought it very odd that they didn\\'t bring us plates or forks with dessert - we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers, carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere, which is not so easy to do when you\\'re drunk on Maggiono\\'s bottomless glass of wine.'b'Ate here for my last meal during my Las Vegas trip and I am pleased to report that it was a great decision. My mom, sister, and I walked on over here from the Wynn and after a few hours of shopping, we were pretty stoked to eat. The salad was a bit heavy on the dressing, but my lasagna was a delicious monster of a thing that went straight into my belly. Also, they give FREE BREAD. Nothing beats free bread.'b'Have been for lunch and dinner and have not been disappointed. Looking forward to more visits. They make my favorite pasta dish (spaghetti with red clam sauce) here and it certainly did not let me down. So much flavor. The bread served when you sit down is fresh and delicious, and was made even better with the oil and vinegar blend served alongside (the italian way, no butter necessary). Service was excellent and the food was hot and fresh.\\n\\nAtmosphere and music were just what you would expect from a fine Italian restaurant.\\n\\nNo complaints here.'b'Honestly, why have I not found this chain sooner!?\\n\\nMaggiano\\'s was my favorite place of my Vegas trip. I must admit, it was slightly biased- I was part of an organization, and the organization catered the food.. so I had, literally, had a TON of food. Nonetheless, it was the best way to try the food!\\n\\nFirst, the appetizers came out. After having the appetizers, I was pretty set on making that my lunch! There was bruschetta, tomato caprese, two types of salad, but my favorite was the stuffed mushrooms. OH MAN, SO GOOD. I was trying to be all professional at this lunch, but all I really wanted to do was to just take the plate of mushrooms and eat off the plate. It was so juicy and flavorful! \\n\\nNext, came the actual entrees. After filling up on the mushrooms and good salads, I was about stuffed already. The entrees were all really good as well! There was the Four Cheese ravioli (mmm, def was one of my faves!), herb chicken, pork medallions (also, one of my faves!), some pasta + vodka dish, and some great tasting beef. It was all really really good.\\n\\nWhat really topped the meal off (well, any meal for all I\\'m concerned about) was the DESSERTS. First, these gigantic profiteroles came out, made out of huge biscuits and lots of ice cream. But, my favorite of all time came out.. the tiramisu!! As tiramisu is my all time favorite dessert, I had high expectations of this dessert.. and it was met. It was the right amount of lightness and the cheese was just right.. I was in heaven. \\n\\nOur waiter was great as well, explaining every item he brought out and was prompt on filling our drinks. He even answered nicely to all my curious questions of, \"so... what exactly is that? What is it cooked in?\" etc. \\n\\nPerhaps my view was slightly biased as I did not even have to pay for this lunch, but all I know, is the food was GREAT, and I would love to find a Maggiano\\'s close to me! Mmm. :)'b\"In Vegas for 1/2 marathon and looking for the required pre-race pasta dinner. Didn't think to check for reservations earlier and most places are booked. Went back to an old favorite and they had reservations available. I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. Huge portions. Nothing spectacular, but very tasty and filling. Husband had seafood pasta (can't recall name), which he really liked. We closed with the cheesecake. Mmmm.\"b\"One star for great prices. The second star for great food. We started out with bread which I thought was very fresh. The Calamari appetizer that we ordered came out fairly fast and was really good. The four cheese ravioli was fairly good and I am very picky when it comes to eating ravioli. It could have been better with more sauce. The third star is for the price which isn't bad. The fourth star goes to the atmosphere which i thought was very clean and well decorated. Minus one star for the long wait for the table and not enough waiters.\"b'Not the 5 stars because it could be a bit less expensive, a bit at least.\\nBut the food, OMG, the food..... have the lobster+crab+etc fettucinni, it was soooooooooo good, the portions huge, really huge.\\nI hope I could eat there again tonight.'b\"I've only been here once and it was delicious!\\n\\nI was staying in Vegas and got tired of eating at the casinos so my friend and I drove around looking for a place to eat when we saw a sign for Maggiano's.  He had been to one in LA before so we gave this one a try.  We were seated right away and, being the klutz that I normally am, I spilled my water all over the table.  Our waiter was super nice and friendly and joked around about it (aka he teased me).  He brought us bread right away and when I spilled water on that, he brought us another basket without us having to ask! \\n\\nI ordered the garlic shrimp linguine and my friend ordered the braised beef canneloni.  We both loved our meals but I think I filled up on bread so I couldn't finish.  We didn't have room in tiny mini fridge in our hotel room so we didn't take home any leftovers; our waiter seemed almost hurt by our almost full plates of food.  I usually don't like creamy sauces but my pasta was very delicious and flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly (I find that with pasta, the shrimp is often overcooked).  \\n\\nThe decor was excellent and everything looked very clean.  I didn't expect much from a restaurant on the second floor of a mall but it was amazing.  I will definitely try and come back here.\"b'This place was pretty impressive. The GF and I received a gift card as a gift so we decided to go check it out a couple weeks ago.  It was packed as we went on a Friday night, but after the experience, you can see why it was so busy. Great food, great drink menu, and the best service I\\'ve ever received. Our waiter, M. (I\\'m not sure if it\\'s polite to mention names even if he was awesome) is probably the best waiter in Las Vegas: polite, charming, and honest. So many times waiters are told to say \"everything is the best\". When asked about dishes and wines that were not his favorite he would say that they were fine but he would really recommend Dish X or Wine Y. It helped a lot that his recommendations were spot on and he wasn\\'t just trying to pad the final bill; a lot of his recommendations were cheaper than what we had first asked about\\n\\nAs mentioned, even though this place had a packed house none of the waiters or waitresses seemed rushed or hurried. The food was cooked perfectly, the view was amazing, and the experience was perfect. The GF puts this in her \\'Top Three Favorite Restaurants\\' category. To directly quote her, \"I love it!\".  \\n\\nI can\\'t believe that this place is a chain. The set up is so nice; dark hardwood, dim lights, beautiful glassware.. It seems so against the whole \\'Here\\'s what corporate sent in a box, let\\'s go throw this crap on the wall\\'. \\n\\nEasily a new favorite. If you happen to get a male waiter whose name starts with the letter \\'M\\', be prepared. You might just get the best waiter in Vegas.'b\"average of 4 stars WHY!!!! we were sat down by some fat little waiter who looked pissed off that he had to work for a living (sorry dude but you suck). he placed oil and balsamic into a dish but seemed to give 3 tables out of the seven around him bread (thank god he didnt do the feeding of the 5000, 3574 of them would have died of starvation)\\n i ordered one of the 'specials' chicken and mushroom lasagne. my experience of a lasagne is that it should be roasting hot straight out of the oven with the cheese bubbling proper italian food. this was slightly warm at best and definately cooked previously frozen and reheated in a microwave POOR! so in all food crap and service even crapper.\"b\"My husband and I love to take the family to Maggiano's when we're in Las Vegas.  The food is amazing but be sure to bring your appetite!  It's family style so it's obviously huge but the portions here seem to be exceptionally large - even for family style. The stuffed mushroom appetizer, the caesar salads and the linguine/clams in red sauce are my recommendations. The service at this restaurant is amazing, as well. My drink was never  empty, they timed each course perfectly so that I was never with too little or too much food at my table and my leftovers were whisked away and returned in cute little brown packages before I had time to even notice they were gone.  Great experience!\\n\\nThe restaurant is, also, on a great part of the strip so you can walk off all the food you just ate while taking in the sights.\"b'We went at around 6pm on a weeknight.  There was a 15-20 minute wait for a table for 4 but there was no wait for the tables at the bar so we opted for this.  Service was excellent.  The portions were very large for the price -- the full size pastas came in 8\"-9\" casserole dishes and about 3\" deep.  Everyone at the table was satisfied with their dishes (fettuccine alfredo, baked ziti and sausage, some type of seafood pasta -- it was on the Little Italy Favorites menu).  I ordered the eggplant parmesan which I wasn\\'t too fond of.  I found it to be too breaded and mushy, not what I\\'m used to.  Otherwise, great atmosphere, great prices.  There was even a wedding party at the table next to ours!'b\"I know this place is a chain restaurant but that doesn't stop it from having delicious food! As you would expect from any decent Italian place the prices are a little high and being right in the fashion show mall doesn't help. Overall the food is great and the atmosphere is what you expect for what your paying. \\n\\nNow for my favorite part about this place. They have something called a Family style dinner. To order this you are required a party of 4. The cost is about $35 per person and completely worth it! This includes the following: two appetizers,two salads, two pastas, two entrees and a desert. Now you might be thinking wow that's a rip off? BUT WAIT there is more to this then meets the eye. All the items have to be selected off the pre-build family menu BUT the portions are UNLIMITED!! for instance if you order 2 appetizers and you greatly enjoy them tell the server and he will bring you another order of them. Same goes with the salad, pasta and everything else. The kicker here is that you ALSO get to take home your leftovers!\\n\\nI would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Italian food! My personal favorite dish is the following.\\n\\nFour Cheese Ravioli +\\nRavioli stuffed with ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella, and provolone filling sprinkled with house cheese, then browned in the oven and served in pesto-alfredo cream sauce with a touch of marinara. \\n\\nIt is AMAZING! It also always puts a smile on my face :)\"b\"After a long hard day of shopping, I wandered upstairs to a restaurant called Maggiano's.  I am so happy I did!  The restaurant itself sounded familiar but I knew I had never dined there before.  \\n\\nOur server Daniel was very attentive and personable, it was my first visit to Las Vegas so he pointed out many things that we could do in our spare time.  This restaurant had a great view.  You could see Las Vegas Blvd, people shopping, or other diners just like me.  Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their experience at Maggiano's and we were definitely enjoying ourselves!\\n\\nWe started our dining experience with the Bruschetta.  It was definitely some of the best bruschetta I have ever had.  I make a pretty killer bruschetta and I was extremely impressed with shredded chunks of parmesan covering the top of the bruschetta.  Splendido!!  The bruschetta was served on Italian Garlic Bread that was topped with a tomato bruschetta relish made of tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and roasted garlic.\\n\\nWe also ordered: the Chopped Salad, the Tuscan Sausage &amp; Orzo Soup, and the Fettuccine Alfredo.  The Chopped Salad was very good.  I ordered it without green onions.  The salad ingredients were iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, and prosciutto tossed in a house dressing.  Most of the items on the menu, they give you the option to order half or the full portion.  Believe me when I say half is plenty when you want to eat more than just one thing.  I ordered the whole chopped salad and it was really big.  The Tuscan Sausage &amp; Orzo Soup contained italian sausage, fennel, white beans and tomatoes.  It was really tasty.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was delicious!  It was prepared with broccoli and garlic in a creamy alfredo sauce.  We only ordered the half portion of that as well and it was really large.\\n\\nOverall my experience at Maggiano's was great from start to finish.  Our waters were never left empty, and our server was always around if we needed anything.  It seemed like all the servers we saw there were on top of their game waiting tables because you never saw a table that needed anything that they couldn't ask the server for.\\n\\nIf you around the Fashion Show Mall and you spot Maggiano's on the 2nd floor, you should definitely wander up there and grab a bite to eat because I assure you it will be worth it.  I will definitely wander back into a Maggiano's even if its not in Las Vegas.\\n\\nCheers and Enjoy!\"b\"Loved it!! My wife and I were both VERY pleased with our dinners and our time here at Maggiano's.  We had about a 15 minute wait for a table, which was no big deal.  Once seated we were greeted by our server.  A kind Italian man, who was very efficient.  This place was extremely clean with a wonderful atmosphere.  \\n\\nThis may be a chain, but I didn't know that until reading reviews before I posted my own.  They do not come off as a chain restaurant to me.  Now compare them to Olive Garden....Not really anything to compare!!  Maggiano's takes it hands down.  The food was rich and tasty.  Salad was decent size, with an amazing dressing that had a touch of spiciness.  I ordered a glass of wine  as did my wife and the bill came to around $60.  Definitely worth the money!!  We will be back when we return to Vegas.\"b\"We took the kids to Vegas for Spring Break last week.  Yeah, I know.  Why the hell would anyone want to go to Vegas with minors?  Ask my wife.  Anyway, we needed to find a place with food that was better than McDonald's for the adults and would appeal to our kids and not bankrupt us.\\n\\nI had the nifty Yelp app on my new, handy dandy Crackberry and it pointed us to Maggiano's.  The app provided many positive Yelp reviews ( of dubious value as usual), a web address and phone number enabling me to call and make a reservation and a map feature that helped us find the place with ease.\\n\\nWe were seated promptly upon arrival and the waiter was very kind to my wife and I in spite of the antics of my three little darlings.  It can be a royal pain to take care of families at a nice restaurant with tablecloths and wine glasses but the service was very good.\\n\\nThe have a full kids menu from which our children were able to choose something they liked.  My wife had some chicken pesto pasta dish which was tasty and I ordered chicken francesca, which was supposedly inspired by the Italian cuisine from St, Louis.  Having become intimately familiar with St. Louis Italian cuisine over the years I think that was a reach but nonetheless my dinner was very good-especially for a chain.  The price was very reasonable and I would love to dine here again but I'm not planning to go to Vegas again in the near future and unfortunately the closest franchise is in Orange County.  Perhaps they'll open a San Diego location some day.\"b'excellent Italian dining in Vegas. They have some great pasta and chicken dishes and a decent selection of wines, but an ok selection of desserts. We went here about 3 years ago and wanted a nice dinner after watching \"KA\" and it was a nice walk to get there and we only waited about 20 mins. We got seats near the window with a wonderful view of the Vegas strip. If you\\'re gonna compare chain Italian restaurants, \"Maggiano\\'s\" little Italy is much better than \"Olive Garden\". I recommend going here to finish off a nice romantic night in Vegas.'b'We went here for a business lunch. The atmosphere was really nice and bright and felt very appropriate for a power lunch. Prices were pretty reasonable. \\n\\n*Hot bread - highlight of the meal! \\n*Chopped salad - the \"crispy pancetta\" was bacon bits, ick, otherwise not a bad salad\\n*For my entree I got the roasted chicken with \"crispy potatoes and green beans\". Everything on the plate was soggy, tasteless and gross. I realize one shouldn\\'t order roasted chicken at an Italian place, hence why this place gets 3 stars instead of 2!!\\n\\nOverall not a bad place to dine on the strip but with so many fabulous options in Vegas it\\'s hard for me to endorse this place. Boring and corporate come to mind. For Italian I prefer Nora\\'s.'b'Place- Nice, spacious great place for a meal. They have private rooms in the back. Clean and bright. They have outside seating. \\n\\nMenu- The lunch specials are not bad. The dinner menu was pretty big. I saw the portions for dinner and they were huge. We ordered the stuff mushrooms as an appetizer and they came to our table in 5 minutes. A little too fast if you ask me. I hope they were not sitting under a heat lamp. Fettuccine in lobster sauce was pretty good. Chicken picatte fed two people just fine. The creamy chicken and potato soup was awesome. Next time, I will order a bowl. \\n\\nService - The service was good. Our waiter, however, wouldn\\'t shut up. Don\\'t you hate it when they keep trying to talk to you and just  go a bit too overboard and waaay too personal with the conversation. It was comment after comment. I could not really enjoy the  time with my friends. At first I felt bad but then I realized that he was borderline flirting with my girl friends. Especially in the end when my friend was trying to get out the booth and he extended his hand an exclaimed \" need some help miss\"? My friend politely said \"no thank you\". While I was thinking in my head \"WHAT A PERVERT\". To be honest, he probably gets off by touching women any chance he gets. \\n\\nMinus one star for the server that wouldn\\'t shut up.'b\"It seems like we end up eating here every time we come to Vegas. This time was a little different because we brought out 2-year old son. I tried to be respectful of the other people eating, so when I made the reservation I requested a table in a far corner of the restaurant. We get there and get seated and they put us at the table in the main dining area in the corner right next to the window that overlooks Wynn. We have eaten at this exact same table before, but not with a baby. Anyway we decided to stay and have a wonderful meal. The waitress was very helpful with my son, from making sure he had a cup with a lid to bringing us extra straws for him to chew on. The food was great like every other time we went. I had some type of pasta with Lobster all up in it. DAMN it was good. I savored every bite. Everyone else in our party loved the food as well. Even when my son screamed a little, it didn't seem to bother anyone else sitting around us. That may have been because we were there for reservations at 5pm and we were there for an hour and a half or so. So many of the dinner people probably would not have started getting there for another hour or so. \\n\\nGreat time again Maggianos, I have a feeling we will be back next time.\"b\"This place is awesome. I never miss a chance to dine there every time I am in Vegas.\\nOur last dinner there was for New Year's eve 2009. \\nI had never ordered family style....be ready for pregnancy pants :-)\\nThey serve an incredible amount of food...great food. The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.\\n\\nOrdering family is style is great when you're a large party (4 or more). The choice is limitless. \\nFor fewer people, I would recommend a la carte.\\nMy very favorite dish is the braised beef cannelloni....The beef and sauce are divine (it's better ordered a la carte than family style as it comes piping hot from the oven rather than on a large plate for everyone to share)\\nTheir spinach salad and Maggiano steak salad are both great.\\nDon't miss the lasagna too and the Apple crostada (so buttery).\\n\\nMaggiano, please open another location in the Bay Area closer to SF or in the East Bay. San Jose is too far!! What about Walnut Creek??\"b\"When 8 people can eat dinner with drinks for $50 a head on the Strip, you've got yourself a great deal.\\n\\nFood is above average - not quite authentic but WAY above Olive Garden.\\n\\nService was great, and they were able to seat our party at 6:00 for 8 ppl without a reservation.\\n\\nBe warned - you will be stuffed!!!\"b'This restaurant has a very classy bar area, clean bathrooms, wonderful patio and helpful staff.\\n\\nWe were waited on by a young guy named Robert who attended to my friend and I wonderfully.  I haven\\'t had service this courteous and prompt in years.\\n\\nMy friend had the \"San Francisco\" lobster linguine but replaced the linguine with wheat penne.  It was SO tasty!\\n\\nI had the \"Chicago-style\" pasta.  It was bland and uneventful.  I even told our waiter but what can they do?\\n\\nThe bread we ate while we waited was fresh and tasty.  \\n\\nThe real value to this place is the Italian dining-like experience on the strip without the large price tag.  I believe there were many lunch offerings for 12-15 dollars and there are a bunch of patio tables to take in the fresh air.\\n\\nIt was all but empty inside but this might be a classy dining experience for couples during the evening.'b\"This place would be a B for me.\\nThe food is great, not excellent but worth the price you pay for.\\nThe best aspect of this restaurant is the beautiful ambiance and the big portions.\\n\\n Although i love Olive Garden, Maggianos is much more authentic Italian food. My usual entrees here are the Lasagna, the Rigatoni D, and the Calamari;] Yum Some of their entrees are good but I've realized that most the white based sauces could taste a little bland along with other pastas, but maybe it just comes down to preference.\\n\\nAlso while you're there take advantage of their delicious bread, we had like 3 rounds when we were there and they provide this dip that has olive oil and balsamic vinegar? not sure. But regardless if you want to eat good italian food with a nice view of the strip, you should consider going to Maggianos!\\n\\ngreat for big groups, families, and dates:]\"b\"Yum Yum Yum pretty much sums up my Maggiano's experience. I went for a wedding reception which allowed me to sample many appetizers and entrees. I was not disappointed in any of them. The highlights were the breaded zucchini which was so crunchy and flavorful. There was a spinach salad that tasted like a party in my mouth, with bits of creamy cheese and pancetta bits. The entrees were equally gratifying, my faves were the salmon on a bed of spinach (cooked to absolute perfection) and the raviolis in a pesto cream sauce. The Chicken Parmesan was also a front runner, the chicken breasts were pounded so thin, yet still juicy and moist. \\n\\nI will definitely venture back to this gem in the mall!!!\"b'All the food here is just really unremarkable based on my visit.  Nothing special, everything seems just unoriginal and aimed at middle of the road palates, not creating anything exceptional or memorable.'b\"I love this place. The enviroment, decor and food. \\nGnocchi in tomato vodka sauce and Chicken pesto are my favorite.. \\nClam with linguine was just a mediocre. It's a place I would go once or twice a month.\"b'Came to Vegas and had dinner here, there was no wait, the waiter had a sense of humor and always asked twice if we needed anything and if we were sure. I love love love Maggiano\\'s!! Their pastas are to die for, espeically the Rigatoni \"D\" and Chicken Pesto Linguine. \\n\\nThe entire restaurant was a bit dark, but it sure did make dinner feel relaxing. I would recommend dressing business casual as this is on the Strip, and to bring an appetite as well. YUMMMM.\\n\\nThe breakdown:\\nFood: A\\nAtmosphere: A\\nService: A'b\"I love the Maggiano's in my home town, so I thought why not in vegas!? It's right across from my hotel and I know the food is awesome.\\n\\nEverything was great until we walked back to our hotel and took a nap. We all woke up feeling super sick. \\n\\nBut lemme talk about the actual experience in the restaurant. It was a super long wait for 5pm but we got hooked up and passed the line. We were seated and everything was brought in a timely manner. The food was the same as always and it wasn't better or worse than any other Maggiano's I've been to except for the part where we all got sick. \\n\\nOh well.\"b\"Went to Maggiano's on Sunday night for surprise engagement dinner. We were a group of 11 and only had to wait around 20 minutes. We were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait. We were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar. I was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting.\\n\\nFrom dinner we ordered the Classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. The food doesn't stop. The only hard part was agreeing on what to order. \\n\\nAppetizers: Calamari Fritt\\xc3\\xa9 and Bruschetta. \\nSalads: Ceasar and Chopped.\\nPastas: Mom's Lasagna and Chicken &amp; Truffle Tortellacci \\nEntrees: Chicken Saltimbocca and Eggplant Parmesan\\nDesserts: Creme Brulee and Chocolate Zuccotto Cake \\n\\nMy favorites were the Chopped Salad, love blue cheese! Chicken &amp; Truffle Tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the Eggplant Parmesan had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right. Creme Brulee was fantastic and huge, but by that point we were so full. I would also recommend the Chianti Castello di Querceto. Went really well with the Mom's Lasagna.\\n\\nRyan was our server and he was fantastic. Very attentive and helpful. They even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance. The night was great. Thank you Maggiano's and Ryan!\"b'My buddies and I decided to eat here while all of us suffered from hangovers.  The delicious food here will restore your apetite from whatever came back out from the previous night.  The family style is a great way to enjoy the meal.  They provide a lot of food for their prices.\\n\\nWe started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite.  It\\'s rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Next up was the Beef Braciole.  This dish was quite interesting.  The texture was weird yet it was edible (may have been my hangover dulling my senses).  I can\\'t quite remember the name of the next dish, but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls, I believe.  The spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state.  You can never go wrong with spaghetti and meatballs.  We also had the Rigatoni \"D\".  The chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying.  \\n\\nThey gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner.  If you love Italian food and pastas, this place would be a place to stop by.'b\"Two stars for the low quality of food.\\n\\nMy friends and i decided to spend our last dinner in vegas at Maggianos. It was a short walk from our hotel and we wanted some REAL food after nights of bingeing on whatever we can get our hands on after the clubs. It is definitely on the expensive side where a half order of pasta will be around 11-17 bucks while a full order will cost you 20+. \\n\\nThey do encourage family style for tables of 4+, but i think the cheapest family style was still around 20 a person. \\n\\nOut of the four of us we ordered: spaggetti with meatballs, lobster alfredo, fettucini alfredo and linguine with clams. All of the dishes were tasteless. I had to drown my linguine with claims with half the bottle of salt  and all my friends did too. Maybe the chef forgot about the salt??  Idk, although the pasta were tasteless, the seafood was fresh and the bread was pretty good too. \\n\\nMeh, I've experienced better is the perfect description for this place.\"b\"I'm a huge fan and love everything about Maggiano's. Decided to take the family as part of our Vegas Birthday weekend getaway. It was my sons 21st and wanted to make it special. Probably a little much for my kids (Young Adults). They are of the Vegas Buffet Breed. But they agreed to check it out.  Had a reservation and asked for the Best table in the house overlooking the Vegas Strip. Dinner was in typical Maggiano style. Hot, Full of Flavor, Huge in serving size just perfect. I would say the only down side was service. Granted the place was full and the it was a Vegas Friday night. Had to ask for water, drinks, rolls, the basics.  The server was not on his game at all. Shame normaly the staff goes above and beyond. Still we had a great dinner and I will be going back to my own local Maggiano's (Woodland Hills) hopefully soon.\"b'Great food and great service.  Perfect for groups with their family style plates.  Deep fried zucchini is a must.'b'I made a reservation on open table and parking was really close and easy. We were seated right away and were blown away by the family style option. Two appetizers, two, salads, two pastas, two entrees and two desserts..all of it is unlimited refills. really awesome food, good wine, nice atmosphere, exceptional service. I will dream about this meal.'b'Great ziti and sausage.'b'Service was iffy. We dd the \"light family\" buffet, which included 2 appetizers, 2 salad, 2 pasta choices and lemon cookies. We ordered the calamari with warm mainara sauce and stuffed mushrooms. For the salad we ordered the Cesar and Chopped (bacon pieces, nano bits of avocado, tomato, and greens). As for the pastas, we ordered chicken linguini and another one, which I forgot. Initially the purpose of doing the family style buffet was to get the unlimited refills, but our waiter was quite stingy with it. \\n\\nHmm, overall verdict?? After going on a strict heavy pasta diet, I wasn\\'t really a big fan of this heavy strict pasta meal. Maybe one day I\\'ll give it another shot and the ratings will be better.'b\"After I left this place I felt very fat.  That's a good thing!  Anyways, we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees just for my wife and I.  BIG MISTAKE!  We should definately shared a entree.  The portions were huge!  We had the stuffed mushrooms and mussles for the appetizers.  They were great.  I had the chicken parm and she had the chicken marsala.  They were bothe great also.   But like I said, we should of just shared a entree.\"b\"I don't see what the big deal is about this place. Yeah the view is nice and all but the food is pretty average at best. We both had the crab cakes and they were horrible! And the service sucks. We were pretty much ignored the whole time during our meal after the food came. \\n\\nThe bartenders kept giving a women who was all ready clearly drunk more drinks. And she fell on her face right in front of our table and almost knocked it over with no apology from management.\\n\\nI should've gone to The Capital Grille instead.\"b'We love Maggianos and eat here every time were in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is as great as the food and the pricing . I would highly recommend making a reservation, we use opentable.'b\"Quick Tip: Great Italian food :) has a small banquet room in the back, too.\\n\\nA friend of mine recently got married and had his reception here. We came in through the back of the restaurant and I was amazed at how beautiful it looked. The hallways were decorated with vintage looking furniture, and the reception hall itself was beautiful. It had a big windown that you can see part of the Las Vegas strip from. Lots of light.\\n\\nThe dinner was sit-down buffet style. We had three courses: Appetizer, Main course and dessert. The food was awesome, most especially because there was only one dish with tomatoes! This was a special Italian restaurant and I was so happy to be able to try all their food.\\n\\nThe salad was excellent: fresh lettuce, blue cheese and dressing. There were two types, but I didn't get to taste the other one. The calamari was really good, too.\\n\\nThe cheese ravioli was a big hit at our table. Something so simple was so delicious, and felt so light in your mouth. There was chicken florentine, a steak with mushroom and then eggplant parmesian. I heard that this one was the best dish out of the main course, but i couldn't sample it. Guess why? :P\\n\\nThe dessert was cheesecake with strawberries, as well as a fruit plate with pineapples, honeydew, cantaloupes, grapes, strawberries, watermelons. Fresh. everything just tasted so fresh.\\n\\nThe best part of this dinner was that we found out that this reception place was a restaurant towards the front entrance. There is a full bar, and it looked like really efficient servers. They were all polite, too. \\n\\nThis is a place to definitely check out if you aren't interested in buffets, or just want to sample a different type of life with Vegas. Definitely a great atmosphere, with great food...and even better with great friends and family.\"b\"Maggiano's is delicious Italian food at prices that won't break the bank. It's a nice atmosphere without being pretentious. The fried zucchini is delicious (they used to have asparagus that was even better), the family style menu is awesome, and the desserts are to die for.\\nThey also have a great happy hour M-F 4-6:30 &amp; Sun-Th. 8:45-10:45 with discounted drinks and app's.\\nTonight I had Baked Ziti, and it was perfect!\"b'Good food at a reasonable price in a very comfortable setting overlooking the strip.'b\"Love Maggianos! Great italian food has never tasted so good. Portions are large so be sure to eat family style. We took our 1 1/2 old daughter and she even loved the place. Seating can be really busy but don't worry as the food makes up for it! Prices are reasonable and not over the board so it's definitely a place to visit. Great location in the middle of the strip and at the mall!\"b'Normally, as a Vegas resident, the last place you go for a good time to drink is the Strip. Sure, it\\'s great for all those vacationing there. But if you live there, you know that you can save the Strip for the tourists. Maggiano\\'s Little Italy is the exception to this.\\n\\nThe happy hour is one of the best that I\\'ve experienced in Las Vegas. Boasting $2.50 appetizers and well drinks with $3 premium drinks and beers. This place is a great place to stop after work. You have to get there somewhat early or be forced to wait outside. The dining area is a bit cramped. But it\\'s best just to situate yourself at the bar.\\n\\nThe appetizers are tasty and not of your typical bar flair. I usually favored the calamari and tomato mozzarella. Free Italian bread with Vinaigrette sauce make it even more delectable. All the better to wash down the drinks with. \\n\\nWith the main dining so close and the tunes of classic jazz standards overhead the ambiance can be busy. But it never seemed to escalate over a dull roar. So keeping conversation is never a problem. Along the walls are classic pictures of \"Old Vegas\" and it\\'s easy to get stopped along the way to the restrooms and take in these old photos as if you were in a museum. \\n\\nThe bartenders pour a mean drink and remember the locals well. This isn\\'t an easy feat when you serve as many drinks as these guys do. Each bartender has their \"specialty\" drink but don\\'t push it down your throat. Ask bartender \"Chris\" about his Poma-tini. It\\'s a pomegranate flavored martini that is refreshing, smooth, and very drinkable.\\n\\nSadly, I\\'ve never had a full fledged meal there. The happy hour was always enough for us. I have indulged in a slice of the cheesecake, which gives the Original Cheesecake Factory a run for it\\'s money. The filling was smooth and creamy and the strawberry topping tart and sweet. And the best part was the price. Only $5 for this massive chunk. \\n\\nMaggiano\\'s Little Italy inside the Fashion Show Mall is outstanding and I recommend this place to any friends who are visiting.\\n\\nThe only think keeping this place from a Five Star Rating is the fact that it does get very busy and sometimes the bartenders tend to lose track of you. \\n\\nFour Stars for:\\nGreat deals\\nStrong drinks\\nSuper Hour\\nTasty appetizers'b'This was my first visit to this restaurant. The decor is nicely appointed; classy yet not ostentatious. The wait staff was young but knowledgeable, friendly and helpful but never intrusive. I had the linguine di mare which was perfectly prepared. It was mildly spicy and contained a nice mixture of lobster, shrimp, mussels and clams. Though I found it very generous with the lovely shrimp, I found it less than generous with the lobster - I found one small piece on my plate. The clams and mussels were tasty but rather small. One of my companions had the seared tuna which he very much enjoyed. The portion was large and was cooked perfectly medium rare with an ideal 1/8 inch seared thickness all around and a rare center. My other companion had the Parmesan crusted tilapia. It was well cooked and tasty. We accompanied our dinner with a bottle of their nice house chianti. For dessert, the three of us shared a generous and quite delicious order of the cannoli cake. With two rounds of drinks and tip, the bill was $240 for the three of us. A very enjoyable experience well suited to a special occasion.'b'For a great Italian meal and an affordable price on the strip, this is the place.  I have come here for a meal every time I am in Vegas for something a little more affordable.  The great thing is the quality of food and service makes you not miss the pricey hotel restaurants.\\n\\nOn my most recent trip, my wife and I made reservations early afternoon for that night.  Our past couple of visits without reservations we had to wait for a table once we got to the restaurant.  This time we were seated right away.  The restaurant was busy for a Tuesday night, but not as busy as we had seen it before.  My wife got the Chicken Parmesan, which is a classic and delicious. I got the mushroom ravioli, which were also quite delicious.\\n\\nThe service was exceptional.  Our food arrived quickly and our waiter was friendly and helpful.  For me, this place is a must on every trip to Vegas.'b'I haven\\'t gone to a Maggiano\\'s in a long time, first time in the Vegas location too.  I made a reservation on the phone for 6:30pm, we got there by 6pm so I asked them if we could be seated.  They were still pretty empty at that time except at the bar where they had happy hour so they sat us in a nice booth seat.  Our waitress wasn\\'t particularly friendly but she did provide good service overall.  She didn\\'t go over the specials either but no problem since I can read it myself.  \\n\\nOrdered the half order spinach salad (I always forget to ask them to leave the dressing on the side.  Did it again this time too and they put way too much).  I remember it tasting a little better but it\\'s probably because there was too much dressing.  I do love my grilled veggies and bacon in it though.  Also ordered the calamari.  It was okay but I wish the marinara was spicy because it tasted kind of plain.  The warm bread with the olive oil and balsamic was yummy.  \\n\\nI only ordered two pastas for three people (waitress said all their dishes are now \"half order\" sized).  Thank goodness I did too because the portions were still pretty big, plus I was already more than half-full from the appetizers and bread.  Got the pesto chicken linguine and the seafood linguine.  The pesto chicken linguine had a ton of pesto, a little too much but when I reheated it the next day, it was so good.  The seafood linguine had a good amount of seafood and the tomato sauce kept it from getting heavy.  We took back over 2/3 of each of the pasta dishes because we were too full by then, even for dessert.  \\n\\nAlthough the waitress wasn\\'t talkative with us, she refilled our water, checked up on us, and gave me two little rolls of ciabatta breads when I asked her to box the few pieces left to go along with our pastas.  Good service and she was well rewarded with a nice tip.'b\"I've been to Maggiano's several times in CA, but this was my first time in LV.\\n\\nThe food was good as always. The fettucini alfredo was the best I've ever had. My sister's chicken parmigiana was pretty tasty too. Again, definitely should share your plates!\\n\\nWhat I loved most about this location was that it's right on the strip, and if you get a table by the window, you get a spectacular view of the Wynn across the street and all the bright lights of the strip. Perfect location for a romantic dinner.\"b\"Very predictable and reliable.  My husband and I have dined at Maggiano's in San Jose (Santana Row) near our house several times and also in Orlando Florida.  We decided for our last night in Vegas we wanted something affordable, reliable and relatively quick- we had show tickets and had gotten back late from our tour.\\n\\nThe Concierge at Encore called to get us a reservation and we were seated right at our reservation time (we got there early just in case), but we had plenty of time without feeling rushed.  We ordered the mozzarella appetizer, which was delicious.  Husband has his green salad and of course the fresh bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is a huge hit!   An affordable bottle of wine to share and for entrees, my fish loving husband actually ordered the beef tips!  He said they were wonderful and they came with mashed potatoes with shoestring onion ring crisps- bit he was too full to eat the sides.   I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was delicious! \\n\\nWe passed again on dessert- simply no room because the food during dinner was plentiful!     \\n\\nThe location is very central- right on the corner of the strip across from the Wynn hotel- which was perfect for us considering we were staying at Encore and had tickets to the show at Wynn.    We would definitely go back again!\"b'Breaking News: Notorious Italian cuisine hater, Archie G., had Italian food for dinner and didn\\'t immediately want to vomit afterwards.\\n\\nOn a business trip in Las Vegas, my speaking manager (who does not speak Spanish) asked me to help him take out our large limited our Latin American distributors (who don\\'t speak English) for dinner. Somehow, I was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. Normally, I shy away from huge responsibility at work. I avoid the break room so I don\\'t have to ever have to take out the trash. That\\'s just how lazy I am.\\n\\nAnyway, with this language challenged arrangement, I knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of Spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. Luckily for me, Maggiano\\'s helped out with the experience.\\n\\nThe two Chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and Italian food. With the help of my Yelp Blackberry application, I suggested Benihana or Maggiano\\'s (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). Ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard Maggiano\\'s and the date was set.\\n\\nFor starters, the staff here is a superb. The hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so I was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as I ran off and went shopping for a little gift for La Novia at the nearby mall. Our server was awesome. How lucky was I that the server was Chilean? He helped out immensely making our Chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. Great guy. Great server. Give that guy a raise.\\n\\nAs for the food, it wasn\\'t terrible. We had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.\\n\\nAppetizers: We had the \"Calamari Fritte\" and \"Stuffed Mushrooms.\" The fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially Ragu. I liked the stuffed mushrooms and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. However, I did wonder why they were not given an Italian name on the menu. Maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of Italian in college?\\n\\nSalads: The \"Chopped Salad\" was a eally good salad. There is no way it can be good for you.  We also had the \"Italian Tossed Salad\" and it was wonderful. Who doesn\\'t love a good tossed salad by an Italian?\\n\\nMain courses: We ordered 4 different main courses. The \"Spaghetti, Meatball\" and I could have made it better at home. The \"Veal Ravioli\" was pretty good. It wasn\\'t as heavy as I had imagined. The \"Gnocchi, Tomato Vodka Sauce\" was my contribution to the group. The gnocchi just melted in your mouth. It was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. The \"The \"Salmon, Lemon &amp; Herb\" smelled pretty bad. I was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. I didn\\'t want La Novia to pick me up from the airport and think I was having an affair or something.\\n\\nDesserts: The Cr\\xc3\\xa8me Brulee was pretty good. We had three rounds of this. I love burnt cream. We had the \"N.Y. Style Cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol\\' cheesecake. I think the \"N.Y.\" stood for \"Not Your.\" As in, \"Not Your Style Cheesecake.\"\\n\\nOverall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. It was factory style Italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. Essentially, it was a pricier version of \"Olive Garbage\" or \"Bucket of Crappo.\"\\n\\nThis was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. But the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. So successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general Las Vegas debauchery.\\n\\nAnd well, I will award another star for that.'b'Had a group of 24, which is big even in Vegas. Treated us very well, fairly fast service and the portions were HUGE. Could not believe that if you finished a dish, they would keep bringing more out. All you can eat with a restaurant atmosphere.'b'Tasty food, but waaaaaaaaaaaaay to much salt.  We got there around 730pm and were told to wait 30-40 min for a table.  They gave us a buzzer, so we went and sat next door.  After about 45 min, we went up to the counter and asked how much longer our table would be.  The hostess checked their list and looked a little flustered... as if our name magically disappeared.  She immediately seated us.  Our server was pretty good at first.  I got the \"famous\" rigatoni D, while my bf got the beef cannelloni.  Both our dishes were very very salty.  For the beef cannelloni, they were very generous with the beef, very sparse on the pasta, and the carrots were undercooked and very crunchy.  My rigatoni was a very big portion, but so salty I ended up drinking all my water for half the dish.  \\n\\nThis brings me to my second qualm...  once we got our dishes, our server went MIA.  It seemed like everyone around us with bigger parties had very good service, while we waited and waited for him to even acknowledge us.  We had to ask for water and even then it took 5 min to get it.  \\n\\nOverall, I\\'d say the restaurant was overpriced (we ended up spending $45 on just those two entrees) and overhyped.  Would I eat here again?  Maybe if someone were treating... and only if I have a full glass of water!'b\"Went back again. Sat at the bar with a friend from Long Island, NY. We had a sensational dinner. Not good, but great. It's basic Italian food. Wine is reasonably priced. Same wine across the street at the Wynn is literally double per bottle.\"b\"If you'd like a light lunch - don't come here - one serve of a main pasta dish will feed a family of 4 for a month!!\\n\\nServing sizes aside, the food is pretty good; heaps of flavour, fresh herbs and all that good stuff.\\n\\nTry the specialty flatbreads - kinda like a small pizza with some superb combinations on top (we had the margharita (sp) with tiny tomatoes, basil and the addition of spicy sausage.\\n\\nThere are plenty of wines by the glass including an Oz wine or 2.\\n\\nNice place overlooking the strip, and being right down one end it doesn't seem to be as over-subscribed as some.\"b\"We had our wedding reception here.  Let me tell you, after shopping the hotels for receptions we knew this was the place for us.  We spoke with Marc, the event person and he showed us their private rooms.  Since we had about 90 people attending, it was very affordable.  The menu we choose was a family style 3-course meal with appetizers.  Since we had some older people attending the family style service was great.  It was all you can eat, but they served everything at the tables so no buffet type of lines.  Everything was done through email and a few phone calls and it was done.  Cassie, the second in charge for catering was extremely helpful.\\n\\nShop around, but the food is second to none and the service staff during the reception were very professional and friendly.  If you have any type of event in Vegas, check this place out.  You can't beat the prices and the food is awesome!!\"b\"You're probably wondering, why would anyone go to Maggiano's during their Vegas trip?  Hey, I love Maggiano's and when you know there's a good place to eat (whether it's Vegas, Boston, Philly, etc) you stick to it!\\nAs always, they never disappoint me.  I ordered the same stuff as I always do- their mussels for appetizer and of course, I always order chicken and spinach manacotti, which is yummy.  \\nI stayed at MGM but I walked all the way over to fashion mall, just to eat at Maggianos and no regrets, b/c it was totally worth it!!!!\"b'Loved it! Good atmosphere, great fooooood! oh and the dessert! yes. \\n\\nNow.. there was a odd conversation we overheard about a guy who was name dropping a whole bunch, as if he was some high roller, other than that, loved the restaurant, service and food!'b\"This place was sooo close to getting 5 stars. However, one thing changed my mind. \\n\\nI had a reservation in the lunch hours, and I was on time and on my reservation notes, I proposed a booth. It wasn't ready when I got there so we had to take a timer and stand around.\\n\\n30 minutes later we got the booth, and it was facing outside which was a good view. This is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. The booth took way to long to get and even when I put it for in advance.\\n\\nThe server was nice and quick, and explained the menu just right. \\nThe food was amazing! I love italian food and decided to go with lasagna, and it was hot and fresh tasting. It wasn't a loud place and was very clean. I wil love to come back to try something else on the menu.\"b'Its been a few years since I ate here and I was shopping and hungry so there ya go. It was about 12 on a Sunday. No wait for a table. They sat me and my little guy down at a nice table in the corner.\\nI ordered a very tasty raspberry iced tea and had one of the specials. it was a crap and sweet shrimp fondue with several toasty wedges to scoop up the fondue. Ryder had the angel hair pasta with olive oil and cheese sprinkled on it.\\nWe both dug right in when it arrived..which it did very fast. I would give this 5 stars but the server let my tea run out and didnt refill it for about 10minutes after it was empty. Not a huge deal but the tea was really good and I would have drank 3 glasses of it..but I had 2.\\nShe was also a bit slow with getting us the check and bringing me the change. \\nI will have to let that slide tho since the food was top notch.'b\"Another affordable dining spot on the Strip for those times when you've just bet everything on red and it's 27 black.\\n\\nFare is solid American-Italian in a spacious dining room on the second floor of Fashion Show mall. The Linguine di Mare is the stuff of my foodie dreams: linguine noodles (the best kind) in a spicy tomato sauce (not spicy enough for me) smothered in seafood goodness like plump, juicy shrimp, mussels, clams and lobster. My only regret was I had to leave some of the pasta behind or risk blowing chunks atop the Stratosphere after (stupid stomach that's sensitive to stupid spinning)!\\n\\nMy boyfriend's Lobster Carbonara could solve world hunger. There was so much of it! It was creamy deliciousness bathed in lobster groupies. Yuuuum!\\n\\nService was pretty slow, though, so try not to come during peak lunch hour on Saturday.\"b\"I could definitely do without the creepy guy walking around playing the accordian, but I'll put up with it for the really yummy food and fun ambiance!\\n\\nWe have eaten here several times and ordered pretty much everything on the menu at one time or another and have never been disappointed.  Some things are better than others, of course (try the chicken and spinach manicotti -- MMMMmm), but overall the quality has always been good, the service fast, and if you can get a window seat, the view is great for people-watching!\\n\\nOh and it sounds really plain and boring, but trust me... try the pound cake for dessert.  YUM!\"b'I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday while we were livin\\' it up in Vegas! A week earlier, I reserved a table for 8pm. We arrived about 15 minutes early and were invited to relax at the bar until our table was ready. \\n\\nSure enough, bang on 8pm we were strutting through the restaurant over to our fantastic table for two with a killer view! \\n\\nWe ordered a wealth of food and some delicious red wine sangria. The food was perfect (I think we did that thing again, where we stop talking for the duration of the meal, due to rapid consumption of said delicious food). Our waiter could\\'ve been around a little more, but was very friendly and responsive all other times, so it\\'s cool. \\n\\nI\\'m gonna go head and call this THE place to eat when you come to the strip. The total for appetizers, entrees, drinks, and dessert was easily the same price that the high end restaurants charge for one person. Not to mention the lack of food those \"high end\" places bring to the table! Maggiano\\'s is perfect for dressing up, chowing down, and hitting the clubs and casinos after!'b\"service here is GREAT! came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. we got hooked up with a nice table right by the window with an awesome view of the strip. our waiter was on it, always coming by asking if we had questions about the menu. he brought out our drinks right away. he was even nice enough to bring out small bowls of salad without any meat in them because one of our friends didn't eat meat. so considerate! we had a party of 8 so we decided to order family style...2 appetizers, 2 salads, 2 entrees with unlimited refills on all food. BEST. IDEA. EVER. we got a taste of everything and there was more than enough food to go around. i love this place! =)\"b\"So, my dad said this Italian eatery in Vegas was one of the best Italian foods he has eaten before. Since my mom and I didn't really know what we wanted to eat for lunch, it was a why not kind of thing. We got there and was seated  within 5 mins, granted this was a lunch hour so i'm guessing there were fewer people there. \\n\\nPersonally, i didn't like our waiter. He sounded insincere. i know that they don't really care whether you've eaten there or not, or if the food it good or not, just act better.\\n\\nWe ordered the fried calamari for the appetizer; i really liked it. My mom ordered the shrimp and crab imperial; that was yummy. My dad ordered some lobster alfredo; that was also delicious. I ordered a steak bruschetta(sp?) and it was absolutely delightful! it was the right portion and i loved eating it. since i'm not a food expert, that's all i can give with the food.\\nThe blood orange italian soda tasted good too; it comes in a fancy bottle.\\n\\nOverall, i much enjoyed this restaurant ^.^, but if i ever want to eat legit italian food, it would be at my friend's house.\"b\"I love this place! My first visit was a few years ago after my brother-in-law said my husband and I HAD to go. I make my share if trips to Las Vegas and I go out of my way to eat at Maggiano's. The decor is very nice. Love the dark wood and old Vegas pictures. The look of the place gives an impression of a much more expensive restaurant but I think the prices are very reasonable compared to some other local restaurants. The service is always great and I've always enjoyed everything I've ordered. My favorite is the Tuscan Sausage and Orzo soup, I order it every time! A must for every Vegas trip!\"b\"This review is for the service that we received at dinner last week. Our waiter Donny was the worst waiter we have ever had! If you go to Maggiano's and get Donny as your waiter prepare to be insilted and treated like idiots when you ask him a simple question. No need to go into details but trust me on this. It is a shame because the waiter serving the table next to us was absolutely wonderful and very professional. Note to Donny, if you do not like people you probably should get out of the customer service business.\"b'My husband and I dined here during our honeymoon in Vegas. We shared a portion of salad, liguine with clams and a couple of glasses of wine. The food tasted great! We made a reservation before we arrived, which recommend for a Friday night in Vegas. The server was nice and attentive so our experience here was positive. I would come here again.'b'I am not sure who reviews this place, but I know now it is not worth the rating that it is receiving. \\n\\nWe went here for dinner on a Sunday night supposedly low season in Vegas. The place was crowded, but that was not so much of an issue. The noise level in the restaurant was pretty high, but if you are lucky you might get a table with a good view of the strip.\\n\\nWe ordered the steamed mussels and crab cakes for appetizer. The grilled salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes.  Kids ate the flat bread pizza and spaghetti with giant meatball.\\n\\n- Crab cakes were okay, the sauce that comes with it is nice\\n- Mussels in red sauce (Diablo if I remember well). When served they smelled funny. My first impression was that the mussels were steamed and a can of crushed tomatoes was thrown over them. Some spaghetti strings were visible, so I was wondering where the sauce really came from?! But, that was not the problem; the smell was just unbearable that I could not eat these mussels. Returned them and was notified by the waitress that it was not the first time that the mussels smelled. Manager came and offered us another dish, we ordered the fried calamari ... and it was okay.\\n- Salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes; the salmon was a bit overcooked and was sitting in the juices of the spinach. Not very appetizing to see, I like grilled fish to remain dry when served. The potatoes were really overcooked and very dry on the inside ... they were left to roast just beyond what they needed.\\n- Flat bread pizza, not too bad for a kids meal\\n- Spaghetti with giant meatball; I am not sure what people like about \"giant\" food, but for me it looks disgusting. \\n\\nWe were not charged for the mussels nor for the fried calamari, which is great customer service. \\n\\nOverall, maybe worth a two or three star but definitely not more than that if you grade it on the food.'b'This is probably the best Italian chain restaurant that I\\'ve ever eaten at. Not only did I enjoy the atmosphere and service, the food was phenomenal! \\n\\nTo start off a very nice family vacation, we decided to eat at Maggiano\\'s and try their family-style dinner. The server - who is probably the best I\\'ve ever met - warned us that it will be a lot of food and very heavy. We took on the challenge and tried their \"classic dinner\": (2) appetizers, (2) salads, (4) main courses, and (2) desserts. \\n\\nAppetizers: Barb\\'s Spinach and Artichoke Dip &amp; Calamari Fritte. They split the spinach and artichoke dip into two plates and had a giant plate of fried calamari. Both were excellent dishes - the calamari was not overcooked and the dip was just gooey perfection.\\n\\nSalad: Caesar and Spinach. I\\'m not a big salad eater, but I heard it was excellent.\\n\\nMain Course: Chicken Piccata, Chicken Saltimbocca, Grilled Salmon Lemon &amp; Herb, and Linguini &amp; Clams with Red Sauce. Each dish was amazing! The Piccata was not overcooked or drowning in sauce. The Saltimbocca, which is fried chicken patties wrapped in prosciutto and cheese, was just delicious! The salmon was good. And the linguini was not drowning in sauce and just the right amount of clams.\\n\\nDessert: Tiramisu and Creme Brulee. Both were just perfect - the tiramisu was just so delicious - not too sweet and not too bland. The creme brulee had the perfect golden crust and was so smooth.\\n\\nYes, it is a lot of food for a table of five. But it gets better for those who think $30 a person is a bit too much. Each plate - from the appetizer to the desert - is refillable! They won\\'t stuff giving you until you tell them no more! So for the price, the service, and the food - Maggiano\\'s is definitely worth it!'b'We went here because we got a gift card for Xmas, I thought it was delish we stared off with the calamari was a little under seasoned but not fishy, the complementary bread was great and then we had a chicken flatbread that was good the waitress was the nicest ever. We had a fifty dollar gift card and ended up using $38 on dinner and two drinks and gave the rest to her for being super nice. Would go again even without a gift card.'b'2 stars is generous after my last trip there which was on Thanksgiving. It was my 4th year in a row eating here on Thanksgiving. I booked a month out and was told the earliest available was 7:15pm. We were seated quickly but that\\'s the only thing that went right. We ordered all parts of the 5 course family style holiday menu and half of what we ordered showed up. They ran out of food at an \"all you can eat\" meal. Instead of being upfront with us we got a dog and pony type of magic show \"disappearing food\". When I approached the manager he asked\" what do you want me to do about it?\" Are you kidding me? $35 per person and you do not have what we want? I am fairly certain I will never go back, that\\'s coming from a Chicago guy who loves Italian food. Also their regular menu item portions have been cut in half and the price slashed a buck or two. Lame.'b\"My boyfriend took me here for our one year anniversary and it was such a perfect place for a romantic dinner. He made reservations for two and when we got there, the table was ready and they were waiting for us! They had us sat at such a beautiful spot next to the window in front of the Wynn Hotel (which is always a sight to see!) \\n\\nWe were immediately treated with bread and balsamic vinegar which was very good! The bread was warm and soft and they kept coming with them! And the balsamic vinegar was also so tasty! We ordered our food and did not wait more then 20/ 25 mins. But we enjoyed it because they had a man walking around playing the violin very beautifuly. We loved it. When we got our dinner it was very delicious and the portions were great! The price was also very reasonable for a restaurant on the strip! They had $14 plate all the way up to $25 dishes. But they had all the Italian classics and many seafood dishes (which was what my boyfriend had, and said it was great!)\\n\\nI highly recomend this restaurant for people who need a good warm meal in a great, soothing atmosphere! \\n\\nThe only reason why I gave Maggiano's Little Italy 3 stars was because towards the end of our meal the waiter was standing (not very far from our table) staring us down, waiting for us to finish up and leave. I found it a little rude and uncomfortable, but other then those last 10 mins it was a great experience.\"b'We ate here on NYE and the service from Nestor was the best. The location overlooking the Strip was great and the interior dark wood style was very nice  I recommend the Salmon and the Pork Medallions.'b\"I won't let you turn around\\nAnd tell me now I'm much too proud\\nAll you do is fill me up with doubt\\nThis time, baby, I'll be bulletproof...at MAGGIANO'S! - La Roux (bulletproof)\\n\\nThank God this place was where i thought it was!! I remember seeing the wynn when i came here a long time ago from the windows since it is on the 2nd floor of its structure but you are never sure, especially since i was running on 5 redbulls for the day and had like 4 hours of sleep from the night before. It was so cold and we were hungry and i was leading us to this place that i thought was here and it was...yay!!! The portions here are awesome by the way..too bad its hard to keep leftovers when you are around in vegas - which is what happened to me lol. Anyways, ordered the lobster pasta and there was a good amount of lobster chunks in it. The side salad had a good portion to it too so i would recommend that if you want the veggies. The ciabatta bread in the beginning was tasty and wanted more. Wish i saved room for dessert, not possible here! Oof maybe next time outside of vegas.\\n\\nFood: 4 stars --- Service: 4 stars --- Atmosphere: 4.5 stars --- Price(value): 4 stars\"b\"*MEN looking to take your gf or soon to be gf or wife on a NICE CHEAP DATE? Maggiano's is the place to go ;)\\n\\nMY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT! I come here about at least twice a month and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere and their delicious food. Make sure you try their Caesar's salad because they honestly have the BEST Caesar's salad. Everything else I've had on their menu has been phenomenal. \\n\\nAt Maggiano's you're able to substitute or subtract/add items you don't like. They also serve bread so an appetizer isn't needed unless you want to order them. \\n\\nOn weekends, it's probably best if you make a reservation just in case cause they can make you wait 25-35 mins for just 2 people, but they do accept walk-ins as well if you're up for the wait or just in the area. \\n\\nAverage bill for 2 ppl with 2 orders of side Caesar's salad and 2 beverages, excluding alcohol...is roughly $40. That price for good food, fancy looking restaurant and is on the strip is hard to find!\"b\"The best meal In Vegas. A fun and affordable choice.  They have never disappointed us and we'll keep coming back. The veal is the way to go, and don't be in a rush for a table.\"b\"Maggiano's is conveniently located in the Fashion Show mall below The Capital Grille.  It was my first time here and the food was better than I had expected.  I went with my beautiful girlfriend for lunch.  She had signed up for their mailing list and received a coupon good for $10.00 off our total meal.  The server was really nice and she even gave us her card at the end of the meal (after she had learned that we were locals).  We ordered Chicken Fetuccini Alfredo, Baked Ziti, and the Fried Zuchinni as an appetizer.  We were about to order more than the Fried Zuchinni for an appetizer, but I'm glad we didn't.  They turned out to be Zuchinni Spears (6) and they were huge! The breading on the Zuchinni was to die for!  It was cooked to perfection. I wonder if they used Panko to bread it?  I highly recommend it.  The Ziti was not that impressive at all.  It was way too meaty and sauce was bland in taste.  My Alfredo was good and rich in taste.  I had no complaints about the service (they even were able to give us a window seat when we asked...no reservation made).  We had a good view of the strip and Wynn casino.  I'd definitely come here again.  I would have scored them 5 star, but the Ziti knocked 'em down.  Next time, I want to try their Calamari!\"b'Great restaurant, great food, great service, it was truly an amazing night followed by Mystere which was an amazing show as well. \\nEven had the 2 little old men come to the table to serenade us! lol'b'My boyfriend suggested this place as an option for lunch because I wanted to eat some type of noodle on our bday (for long life) and I\\'ve been craving Italian. Of course I made a reservation on OpenTable, went to the website, checked out the menu, signed up for the email list, and received a $10 off coupon right away!\\n\\nIt\\'s kind of nice because when you sign up they give you a $10 off coupon and when you submit more info on your profile for them they give you another coupon for a free dessert! I stuck with the $10 coupon though since I had more than enough birthday cake already. \\n\\nOur reservation was at 12:30pm. We came in and all the booths with views were taken, but they were able to give us one of their 2 seater tables right next to the window, so that was nice. We got our water and complimentary bread right away and the waitress came over to give us some suggestions on appetizers. She suggested the bruschetta, but we ended up ordering fried zucchini. \\n\\nAfter looking over the menu we decided to order fettuccine w/ chicken and baked ziti. I\\'ve never ordered baked ziti from a restaurant, it\\'s always been at little food courts in shopping malls, so I was hoping for something pretty delicious.  \\n\\nThe zucchini arrived and boy were they huge! My boyfriend and I both looked at the zucchini, then at each other and said at the same time, \"wow, those are zucchini spears!\" There was about 6 of them so we got three each. It was pretty tasty. The breading was light and the lemon aioli went perfectly with it. It was a little too big for two though, especially since you get the complimentary bread; I was only able to finish a spear and a half. \\n\\nOur food came and it looked delicious. I almost dove right in without taking pictures! I took a bite of my ziti, and I was a little disappointed. It just tasted very salty and not at all like I expected. Maybe I\\'m just so used to the ziti at the mall (which I love!) that I\\'m not used to authentic style ziti? I tried my boyfriend\\'s fettuccine shortly after and that dish was heavenly! I\\'m really happy he let me take the leftovers home!\\n\\nI really didn\\'t eat much of my ziti at all, especially after trying the fettuccine. I think I just ordered the wrong dish, I\\'m sure their other dishes are yummy.  We asked for a togo box and gave the waitress the coupon. She came back with an aluminum container with a cardboard top and a little baggy of fresh bread. \\n\\nI think our bill only came up to about $25 dollars because of the coupon, so that was definitely a nicely priced lunch!\\n\\nOverall the food was delicious, except for the ziti. The service was quick and courteous. The  view was beautiful. 4 stars and I\\'d love to come back to try their dessert!'b\"My family and a friend met up at Maggiano's in Fashion Show and I'm experiencing mixed feelings about it. \\n\\nLocations: Great place to meet but mall closes before the restaurant. It makes the underground parking difficult to access. Consider using the valet. \\n\\nService: Our server was very nice but she also presented the olive oil/balsamic vinegar plate in front of my four year old. It was a very messy spill. \\n\\nFood: Pretty good overall. The fried zucchini appetizer is always good. My friends chicken salad looked fine and my pepperoni flat bread was not interesting in the slightest. \\n\\nSummary: I'll go back if encouraged but great Italian food is easy to come by in Las Vegas. I'm not rushing back.\"b\"I was introduced to this restaurant when I use to work in the OC.  I love this chain compared to Olive Garden.  Every time I have been to a Maggiano's whether it is OC or here, I always seem to wait a little.  Just my luck probably.  We like the atmosphere and the food is good.  Below are the usual that we order:\\n\\nAppetizers: Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms\\nPastas: Spaghetti Meatball, Fettuccine Alfredo, Lasagna\\nDesserts: Creme Brulee, Tiramisu\\n\\nPastas are very well prepared as well, but our favorites that keep us coming back are the appetizers and desserts.\\n\\nThis is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to.\\n\\nThe only thing that was a turn off for us for this location was that the outdoor dining we had to put up with someone that was smoking at a nearby table.  We have kids so this was rather inconvenient.\"b'I like this place, the service is excellent. They have a full bar, the flat bread is good start, also the calamari. The lobster carbonara is great i also the seafood pasta is good. I tasted the salmon as well. i think i will order that next time. one thing you should do is call ahead for reservations. This will save you some headaches waiting. Also allow a extra 15 minutes get through the strip traffic and parking.'b\"My husband and I had our wedding dinner here with a small group of guests (13 total). We did a family style dinner which I was allowed to order before we arrived so everything would be brought out without waiting a long time. The food was delicious! We had a lot of food left over for lunch the next day.....it tasted even better! Our waiter was fabulous as well as very friendly. Family style is definitely the way to go if you have a big group and are on a tight budget. \\nThank you everyone at Maggiano's!!\"b'Great place!!! Waitress was kind of slow but still attentive.'b\"We always end up eating here at least once every time someone comes to visit us. :) My husband is a big fan of italian food, so it works out great. He can never get sick of spaghetti, but i like trying different things... chicken alfredo or chicken marsala seem to be my main dishes :) \\n\\nThe location is perfect! Shop a little til you get hungry, then go to Maggiano's. Or eat first, then shop... either way, its a win-win. There might be quite a wait if you go around 6 or 7pm, but if you go there for lunch or something it works out perfect.\"b'This place is great!!! I recommend the homemade Lasagna. I would definently go again :), what got me disappointed a little was the server she was slow.'b\"My sister, who lives in Vegas, took me here with her friends when I was visiting. With so many options on the strips, I was wondering why this was one of her favorites. Located in the Fashion Show Mall, the restaurant has easy access and parking. It has a great location. \\n\\nThe ambiance is just like every other Maggianos, with only about 1/3 of the tables having a view of the strip. We had made reservations for 8:00pm on a Wednesday night, and arrived 10 minutes late. Granted the restaurant was packed as ever, but there were empty tables. The Ma\\xc3\\xaetre de gave us such a stern look of disapproval and then gave us a buzzer to wait near the bar. We waited for almost another 25 minutes, are you kidding me? \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated at a table in the back, it took us way longer than expected to get the attention of the waiter to take our order. Maybe they have a problem with the ratio of tables per waiter. We could see that he was working hard, but we were hungry as well! The food was delicious, as expected. All of us were stuffed and enjoyed our meal. We actually loved the two elderly men who came to sing at our table =) The one with the Violin reminded us of the man in UP. With such good food, we were happy to have several boxes of leftovers to enjoy the next day. \\n\\nBut then, at the end of the night when we were paying the bill, we asked the waiter to split the bill amongst the guests. One of our friends actually paid in cash and the waiter actually assumed that his bill was his tip. This is before we got the receipt back to sign. The waiter assumed, and gave himself a 25% tip! That has never happened to me before, and sadly I have to say he didn't deserve it. Overall we had a great time and I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would hope they would improve on their service between then.\"b\"This is a chain restaurant, but it doesn't feel like it. It's interior suggests something closer to fine dining, but the prices are actually really reasonable. One of the best things about it is the view it has.\\n\\n It's pretty basic Italian food, but you'll feel like you are getting more than your money's worth.\"b'Will never come here ever again! Horrible service!'b'This is by far the best Maggiano\\'s I\\'ve been too. \\n\\nI\\'ve been to the California location, as well as the Washington D.C location, and this one takes the cake.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I make a 2 week trip to Vegas every summer. This past year, we decided to dine at Maggiano\\'s afters having a good experience in CALI. The food here is SOOOOOO good, we ended up dining here 5 more times before we left. \\n\\nI recommend going with a group of 4 or more, because they have great \"package deals\" for larger parties. You can choose between 3 different price groups, all that come with different options, which are all reasonable and well worth the money. \\n\\nI\\'m absolutely gaga (No lady, stay out of this one) over their Chicken Francese and their mash potatoes. To DIE! Their Chicken Francese is not traditional, however. It is breaded and then smothered in lemon sauce. I\\'m drooling just thinking about it.\\n\\nDid I mention they don\\'t stop bringing more food until you tell them too? GO HUNGRY!'b\"This maggiano's is pretty pleasant, perhaps an alternative restaurant if you just spent too long at fashion show and cannot dare cross the street (the obstacle of crossing the street from point a to point b has left me 20 minutes late PLENTY of times, even if it's just from saks to the wynn!). Also a good restaurant for bigger portions--their plates can be a foot long for a single person. Big portions! A homey feeling, which is very common for them.\"b\"3 1/2 stars to be fair.\\n\\nI went to Maggiano's for lunch during a business seminar.  Don't you just love some free food every once in a while for all your hard work?  It was certainly a nice treat for me!\\n\\nAfter initial introductions and the start of the seminar, food starting coming out of the kitchen.  All served family style which was a bit odd for me because I barely knew the two dozen people in the room!  But ah, not a big deal as long as none of them had herpes or mono...or a cold for that matter.\\n\\nOur appetizer courses came first:  along with warm French bread (excellent) we had the:\\n\\n*Tomato Caprese - tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, topped with olive oil and balsamic glaze\\n\\n*Mozzarella Marinara - breaded mozzarella with marinara sauce\\n\\n*Maggiano's Salad - Iceberg and romaine lettuce with bleu cheese, crispy prosciutoo, red onions, topped with their signature dressing\\n\\nPretty good start!  The salad was crisp, but my fav was the Tomato Caprese, sweet and ripe tomatoes with the silky cheese and the acidic touch from the balsamic?  Very nice!  I didn't try the Mozzarella Marinara in trying to keep with my P90X diet...damn you I say Tony Horton!\\n\\nNext up was our main courses:\\n\\n*Chicken Parmesan - Breaded chicken breasts baked with Provolone cheese and marinara sauce over spaghetti\\n\\n*Our Famous Rigatoni 'D' - Rigatoni with herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions with a Marsala cream sauce\\n\\n*Mom's Lasagna-Meat Sauce - Pasta layered with Ricotta cheese, meatballs, Italian sausage, and marinara sauce, topped with Provolone cheese and meat sauce\\n\\nNice!  All were good.  Unfortunately, I ate like a banshee here...I dug the Chicken Parmesan and Mom's Lasagna very much!  The sauce was great, not too sweet, not too tart, and complemented the dishes very well.  Oh my thighs...the horror!!!\\n\\nAfter the business presentation dessert was brought out:\\n\\n*Apple Crostada - Granny Smith apples baked in a pastry crust topped with crystallized sugar, topped with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream\\n\\n*Chocolate Zuccotto Cake - Chocolate cake layered with sambuca chocolate mousse, iced with chocolate frosting, then dusted with cocoa powder\\n\\nAt this point I was too full to have any more!  But I gave in and had a bit of the Apple Crostada.  Yummy to my tummy!  The tart apples went well with the sweet sugar crust.  Good way to end the meal.  Bad way to end my diet!\\n\\nFood here is great for a chain restaurant.  The ambiance is nice, dark woods and colors.  It would be very nice for a date night out.  I may just come back here again and actually shell out my Visa to try more of their dishes.  As a note though, I did look through the menu and see a lot of their dishes are on the pricey side.  But, one dish could probably feed two people easily. \\n\\nThankful for my one day reprieve...I am back to my P90X diet and the ramblings of the Devil's Spawn named Tony Horton.  One more push up or pull up and I think I'm gonna be sick!\"b\"2 1/2 more like it. \\nThey put lots of food on the plates, it's just that it's really nothing too special. The best of the lot we tried were the mussels, and the side spinach salad was okay as well. \\nAs for the veal picata, or the crab cakes...would  pass on them. \\nWines in the limited selection are reasonably priced. \\nAlong with the large portions, prices are reasonable.. and that keeps the place packed with patrons... reservations are recommended.\"b\"7 of my girls and I went to Vegas to celebrate 2 of their birthdays. We didn't have the coupon for BOGO but he still let us take home 7 classic pastas home for free with the order of 7 classic pastas at the mention of the coupon. Service was great and I can't get enough of the balsamic vinegar nd oil and bread. Although he did forget about the birthdays and i had to remind him again to bring out the cookies in the end. Since it WAS a classic pasta, the lasagna was a little dry, fettucini was extremely bland, but the spaghetti was really goodand came with a good portion.This was my 2nd time here And the first time was in San Jose. My first experience was better because we didnt do the BOGO and ordered specialty pastas and seafood. But I guess you get what you pay for.\"b'HORRIBLE FOOD POISONING.  My first night moving to Las Vegas I ate there and got terrible food poisoning.  I had a steak and got what was most likely E. Coli poisoning.  Would not recommend going to this place. There are much better places for Italian food even without the food poisoning.'b'II have a gluten problem and have celiac disease i have been to this restraunt several times over 25 times.The food is very good.However if you have an allergy or a gluten problem i can no longer suggest  this restraunt.The last 2 out of 4 times i had eaten there they brought me out my salad with croutins in the salad which some of you who have the problem becomes a big problem. Thank god i caught this before i ate it. I ordered my meal through the chef per usual 2 times they brought me out items that have gluten out of the last 4 times i ate there.The problem is they have no checking sytem there.A diffrent waiter brings out your food .They have no idea whats going on.The margin for era is to great.They say they accomodate allergies and gluten free. The problem is the caring level is not there anymore in this place.Note both times this happened at the restraunt it was not a weekend or that busy.So that excuse is down the drain.My question to the manger was what if this was a child that had a serius allergy and went into shock.Then what.He said it never happens.My response funny to me i was here 3 weeks ago and the same thing happened. there was no response.'b'I went here for lunch and will not return. With so many options in Vegas for food, the details count. I asked for Maggianos Salad and I received it although it tasted like it was premade 5 hours prior with soggy lettuce.  The flatbread was good and the service was bad hence the 3 stars. A restaurant such as this should not be sending out pre-made salads with soggy lettuce.'b'We have had good experiences here and not so great ones...it is, after all a chain restaurant and lacks the personalization we prefer. The lasagna is the highlight of the menu. I am not a huge lasagna fan so I often find myself trying some type of seafood dish, which I have found they over-sauce. The service was decent but we prefer to pick up here rather than dine-in, as it has a stuffy feel to the atmosphere. \\n\\nPros: Good take-out, yummy lasagna\\n\\nCons: Ambiance, seafood dishes'b\"I'm all in for this place. I just wish i felt better to better enjoy the food!! \\nAfter a wicked Friday night, i just wasn't feeling it. Def needed some food and well the GF and were set on finding something gluten friendly. Enter Maggiano's and their gluten free pasta. Not to mention you can actually talk to the chef if you have some question. A+ \\nI ordered up the Angle hair pasta with Italian Sausage and some kind of chunky diced tomato sauce.. AWESOME it was that was. The gf chopped it up with the chef for a minute and he came back with a baked zitti *Corn Pasta* type thing with chicken and tons of cheese. I stole a bite or two and yup YUMMO! \\nThe place looks super upscale and ultra expensive but really for where you're at and it being on the strip, it a must go.\"b'Amazing Italian food.  Good service.  Great for large groups.  We had 10 people and ordered \"family style\" and had more food than we knew what to do with.  I will continue to go here every time I am in V-town.'b\"Closes at 11:00PM on Saturday night. WTH? This is Las Vegas, for heaven's sake! We rolled in at about 10:52PM and were denied.\"b\"It was a sad, sad morning when I realized that with my newly gluten-free-ness, I couldn't run to greasy pizza as a hangover remedy.  I was soooo so happy to find Maggiano's though!  The BF and I were on a quest, and we came across the menu that graciously advertised gluten-free pasta, so in we went.\\n\\nThe server was a SUPER HAPPY fella, who brought the chef over to customize my meal basically however I wanted!  I ended up with some baked corn pasta with chicken, marinara sauce and cheese - DELICIOUS!! \\n\\nIt's classy inside, but the lunch prices were totally fine (for Vegas standards, that is), plus the portions were huge.  The waiter kept our water coming and even gave the BF two glasses at a time ;)\"b\"As I was shopping at Fashion Show Mall I noticed this Italian restaurant and made a mental note to check it out on Yelp later for a possible dinner option.\\n\\nAccording to Yelp this place was worth trying. I used the open table feature to make a reservation (not knowing if it was really needed or not, but I figured why not). I'm glad I did. When we made it in to the restaurant it was packed and there was a wait. We were seated immediately. \\n\\nWe were seated in a comfortable booth seat, and served water immediately and given some explanation of the menu. This place had a good variety of Italian food from pastas, to chicken, beef and seafood selections. I liked that they had a family style option as well. At first glance I would say this place looks pricey specially since your entr\\xc3\\xa9e comes with just your entr\\xc3\\xa9e no salad or soup like Olive Garden. \\n\\nWe ordered a side salad to share that was $4.95 but it was the perfect size for two specially since we were stuffing our faces with the yummy French bread served with olive oil and vinegar (oh so yummy, and dangerous!). \\n\\nOur plates took over 30 minutes to arrive, if it was not for the bread and salad I would have been more upset. \\n\\nI ordered Mom's Lasagna made with meatballs and sausage with your choice of marinara or meat sauce. I choose marinara since so much meat came with the dish already. My plate arrived and what do you know, it probably could have served four people, fairly large portions. I ate all of it, in phases but I ate it all. It was exquisite. Perfect layering, the lasagna stayed together (I hate when you cut into lasagna and the layers fall apart). \\n\\nMy favorite part was being serenaded by a duo (violin and guitar) to one of my wedding songs (It's Impossible). If it weren't for the Wynn in the background I could almost say I was in Italy.\\n\\nI don't have any complaints about this place. Our total bill came to $37.50: two entrees, one side salad and one beverage. We came on a Monday night and it was busy so definitely try and make reservations if you can.\"b\"This has to be my favorite italian restaurant in Vegas. It feels like you just wanna be with your family when you come here. Eggplant parmesan with meat sauce is one of my faves. I wouldn't normally order fried calamari at any other restaurant but it's the first thing I wanna order when I get here. It's light and not chewy which I looove! My son eats up most of his spaghetti and can't get enough. Mama's lasagna is pretty mean too. I'm looking forward to trying other stuff on the menu. but all i can think about is the eggplant parm!\"b\"This place is always good. Nice atmosphere, no long waits, food is great! Best of all, it's located on the Strip within the Fashion Show Mall. My only advice? Arrive by 6pm for dinner, or you may have a bit of a wait.\"b\"Stopped by for lunch, and wasn't disappointed.  I got the chicken piccata (loved it!) and hubby got the lobster carbonara (fantastic!).  Bread was nice &amp; fresh, all soft &amp; yummy inside the crispy exterior, but the side salads were rather boring.  Will definitely go there again.\"b'Good portions , Good prices and delicious food !'b\"I had no idea that the best meal I would eat in Las Vegas would be at the mall of all places. We had a meal at Craftsteak and I'd trade it for the one we had here any day.\\n\\nOur server was a tiny, bubbly blonde who I wish I could have put in my pocket and taken home with me. She was sweet and happy and very personable.\\n\\nWe ordered an appetizer of and then I had the fettuccine Alfredo while my husband ordered linguine and clams with the white sauce. \\n\\nThe app was simply prepared and just lovely. My Alfredo was smooth and creamy. It was very flavorful and not oily at all. The linguine was bursting with clams. Nicely prepared with most of the clams tossed in with the pasta and a handful still in shells scattered over top. The wine sauce was fantastic.\\nWe also had red wine which was their special house red blend. Also excellent!\\n\\nWe were completely stuffed and declined dessert, but our awesome waitress showed us that they serve little mini desserts for just $2.50... I went with the chocolate cake and my husband got the crem\\xc3\\xa9 br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e. They were both, of course, to die for. So good!\\n\\nIn the end I found myself not wanting to go back to the hotel and leaving the lovely atmosphere (with lots of Frank Sinatra playing in the background) and warm, comfortable interior of the restaurant. It was just lovely.\\n\\nLike I said, best meal we had the whole trip!\"b\"I've been here a few times. Mostly its been good. But, There is only one good thing I can say about my experience with Maggiano's this last time. The Waitress was great. She was on the ball all night.\\n\\nBut, The meal was horrible. I could not believe how bad it was. It wasn't just one thing. It was everything. From the bread to the Wine. Yes, even the Wine was bad. I couldn't finish the meal. And no. I did not take a to go box.\\n\\nThey must have a new Juan or Hector cooking the food in the kitchen.  It certainly didn't taste like an Italian was cooking.\\n\\nTerrible meal\"b'Came back to Maggiano\\'s for what my friend and I call \"Wine Wednesday!\" We used to have this event (of 2 people, haha) every week but as we all know people get busy. I find it a great place for happy hour wine and appetizers. They have added some new items to the menu from when we used to go, but that\\'s great! \\n\\nI had last my voice the previous weekend so the bartenders were having a good time with me while I waited for my friends. They are very friendly guys and very attentive. I got there about 445pm and found seating at the bar right away. Once my friends did get there I ordered the Merlot and the bartenders were on top of it! \\n\\nFor food I ordered the bruschetta and crab cakes, soooo yummy! I think I could continually eat the crab cakes. Just keep them coming! Overall, my experience here is always great. The food always comes out perfect and great service. I have yet to come and eat for dinner, whats holding me back? Oh yah I live in the NW and this place is easy to come to after work. One day I will though!'b\"I went here for a wedding dinner party. So considering that they were serving a party of about 25 they did an awesome job. We had so much food I must have gained 5 lbs leaving there. We had a variety of different dishes from spinach-artichoke dip, bruschetta, lasagna, spaghetti, fetticuni alfredo - I can't even remember the rest. But it was very good - ALL OF IT! The servers served all of us quickly, the food was hot and delicious and the ambiance was very romantic!\"b'I was in-between 4 and 5 stars on this one, but I had such a good time, I bumped it up. \\n\\nThe wait was a bit long, but decent considering that it was a Friday evening in Vegas with no reservation. This place is not expensive, especially for what you are getting.  Also, it has a much nicer feel than any other \"family\" Italian eateries without being stuffy.\\n\\nOnce seated, we received pretty good service with a smile.  I wasn\\'t able to try the bread that was complimentary, but everyone at my table seemed to enjoy it.  The apps (calamari and zucchini) were delish.  At some point in the evening, we were serenaded by two men playing instruments.  I have fond memories of Steve singing along, lol.\\n\\nEveryone also seemed to enjoy their pasta dishes.  This place serves everything family style, so if you don\\'t want to share, be prepared to take a doggy bag.  I ordered the pesto linguine with chicken and it was DELICIOUS.  Warning:  you should REALLY love pesto to order this dish.\\n\\nWe were WAY too full to have any dessert, but the options sounded promising.\\n\\nTip:  They have skinny cocktails if that\\'s your thing.  I had the skinny sangria and it was yummy.  Too bad it didn\\'t matter with all of the food that I inhaled!'b'In addition to the outstanding food and service, the servers at the bar were friendly and showed genuine interest in new and regular customers. Their Italian food and wine selection are excellent, but this time around I tried their grilled salmon. A very busy place but worth the short wait.'b\"I can't believe I just found out about this place.  I'm a HUGE fan after just one visit!  I was blown away by the tiramasu.  The service was incredible.  The entrees were delicious. The atmosphere was very elegant as well.  You really can't compare Maggiano's to the other chain italian places because they are in a category all their own.\"b\"Maggiano's is a nice place to go to when guest are in town. It is a step above Olive Garden, but not as costly as Rao's. There is always a line, so that is a good sign that they are doing something right.\\n\\nIt has been more than two years since I have been able to get back to this Italian restaurant. I wanted to see if it is as good as I remembered. When a friend came into town, it was the perfect opportunity to visit. The wait was estimated for 30-45 minutes, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. They make a skinny sangria that tastes like fruit punch. It is lethal and easy to knock back. My friend ordered the frozen peach bellini and it tasted like a smoothie. Most of the drinks cost around 8-10 dollars. Not bad for being on the strip.\\n\\nWhen we were sat, the server promptly greeted us and filled our water glasses. The service was impeccable. She was friendly, attentive, and non intrusive. \\n\\nWe had ordered the calamari appetizer to give us some time to decide on our entree. Apparently it took some time to come out, but we did not notice. Caught up in our conversation and snacking on the bread made time go by quickly. \\n\\nOur waitress gave some great suggestions and I decided on a dish that would help the Make-a-Wish foundation. Right now, they have a few specialty items that Maggiano's will donate a portion of the proceeds to the charity. The roasted chicken farfalle is delicious. The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente, the chicken moist, generous amounts of spinach, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, topped with parm slivers. The broth like sauce at the bottom made the dish light. I was happy that I could get something that was not cream based and not have to settle for marinara. My friend had ordered the chicken pesto pasta and it was good. You must love basil and pesto to get this meal because it is bold. I would order it again. \\n\\nOverall this was a nice meal. I would not hesitate to go back, but next time I will skimp on the bread to save some room for dessert.\"b'This was quite possibly the best Maggiano\\'s experience I have had across three states.  When another reviewer claimed that  it was a \"step above the Olive Garden\" they were spot on.\\n\\nMy mother and I went here for Thanksgiving dinner while in Vegas avoiding family obligations.  We were able to make reservations online, which was fairly convenient and helped us avoid a long wait.  We were also able to order off of the special Thanksgiving menu, which was a great mix of the traditional Thanksgiving fare coupled with some Italian favorites.  They also brought you more of anything you wanted in spite of the original portions being humongous.  \\n\\nOverall, our experience was nice and we talk of a repeat dodging of the manicness that is Thanksgiving with the inclusion of our Maggiano\\'s experience.'b'I was with a group of ten and after finally deciding on Italian food for dinner, we headed to Maggiano\\'s.  It was a Monday night at 8pm and it was pretty crowded.  We were told that we HAD to order off the family style menu even though the menu clearly states that they \"ASK parties of 10 or more to order Family Style.\" There was no mention anywhere that this was required.  After asking if it was possible to order individual entr\\xc3\\xa9es, the hostess looked at us like we were stupid and asked \"why?\"  I simply stated we all have different tastes and one person in our party had food allergies.  Then what looked like the manager came over and told us that the kitchen could not accommodate a group of ten individual entr\\xc3\\xa9es and that the only way we could do that is if we split into two groups of five HOWEVER this would make the wait even LONGER.  We were confused because the kitchen would still be making ten orders but whatever.  We were annoyed with them already and decided to leave and check out El Segundo Sol, the Mexican restaurant right below Maggiano\\'s.  Read my review of El Segundo Sol, they definitely took care of us!'b\"Italian is not always my favorite because it typically involves a lot of carbs..  I am best staying away from it.  Of course I always manage to order anything but pasta so I am probably missing the best part.\\n\\nI've been here a few times and never been there without a 30 min wait.  Nevertheless I enjoyed the service and the food each time I've been there.  It's not cheap but you will for sure leave with a very full stomach. \\n\\nPersonally I find the musicians performance somewhat annoying.  Maybe because I have always come here with a group and it's hard to have a conversation with that in the background.  I am not sure if I was on a honeymoon I would like it either.  Just not working for me.\"b\"This place was pretty good. The bread they brought to the table was ok, but the salad and the lasagna I ordered were both good and the mini cheesecake at the end was sooo yummy!\\n\\nMy boss, who is um, particular, didn't have such a good experience as his pasta was over done, but the waiter was nice and replaced it for him. I'm a pretty laid back diner so I kinda felt bad when my boss corrected him, etc but he handled it well.\\n\\nThey were great about refilling my water a ton of times. I'm on dr. orders to drink over a gallon a day so he helped me along:)\"b'This place is like a fancy Buca di Beppo.\\n\\nWe ordered the Old Famous Rigatoni, Baked Ziti Pasta, and the Surf and Turf.  The only thing I enjoyed was the Famous Rigatoni, very flavorful and delicious.  The baked ziti pasta was very bland and tasteless.  The surf and turf was a mistake for a pasta place.'b'Went here for dinner over the weekend and man my experience here was really good!  The place was really kept nice, real clean and the staff was incredible.  I had the New York Steak 16oz.  which was amazing, our waiter Taylor did a real good job waiting on us and always kept coming back to see if we needed water or anything else.  Overall I would recommend this place if your in town and want to dine on some good italian food.'b\"I love the ambiance here, and sometimes if you want the Vegas Strip, but not the feeling of chaos, this is the place to be. Lunch on the patio is fantastic, and is quite a unique people watching scene. I love their salads, wine menu and chicken marsala.  Usually, the service is great and the kitchen is consistent.\\n\\nBe careful of the following:Their salads are spot on, but their house dressing  is on the sweeter side.  I personally prefer the italian which is homemade but not nearly as sweet.  Also, if you are not a fan of shaved chicken breast, then you should avoid adding chicken to your salads. It is not your usual chunky  breast. \\n\\nThis establishment is way better than your typical Italian chain, and has incredible  family portions. Salute' to Maggiano's-you keep me coming back for more.\"b\"Spent our one year anniversary lunch here while in Vegas.  We couldn't really decide where to go and were in the mood for Italian so we decided to give it a try.  We were seated immediately and our server was extremely nice and attentive with great recommendations.  \\n\\nWe started with garlic bread - garlicky but not overwhelming.  It was good.  I had the chicken marsala, which I really enjoyed, the chicken was moist and the marsala sauce was just enough.  My boyfriend had the baked ziti and he really enjoyed the pasta as well - it was al dente with the right amount of sauce/sausage/cheese.  \\n\\nOverall, it was a good experience.  Will definitely go back again.\"b\"When in Rome do as the Romans, when in fashion show mall eat at Maggianos.  the fired zucchini app is my wife's favorite item on the menu.  Portions are large and certainly shareable for lunch and dinner leftovers will be available the following day.  I like this place a lot...\"b\"Yummm! Our dinner was so much more than I ever expected. Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The portions were huge! I couldn't believe how reasonably priced the menu was as well. We had a corner window table that overlooked the strip. It was perfect for the kids. Strolling musicians and the best chocolate cake topped off the evening! We are going back for a second time tonight and will be sure to visit Maggiano's back home as well.\"b\"I love the food here. It is really worth the price, which really isn't bad for the quality or quantity. \\n\\nI have been here twice and the only down side was the service. Our first server was decent, yet our second server was unobservant, and somewhat rude.\"b\"This place is a true gem on the Las Vegas Strip.  Walking into this place you would think it's a five-star restaurant with prices to match but thankfully, the prices here were very affordable and in true Italian style, the portions were very large.  We would have taken what we had left-over to go but with no place to heat it up at our hotel, it wasn't worth it.  Located in the Fashion Mall, if you love Italian food, this is the place to be.\"b'Very good food. Nothing mind blowing, but a solid Italian meal. Kind of similar in quality to Bucca di Beppo.\\n\\nWe would go back.'b\"Food is really good, price is very reasonable for that quality and quantity.  The chicken pesto and bruschetta were delicious. It wasn't too heavy like other Italian restaurant that I've tried. \\nService is great, and the atmosphere is good too. I love the booth, it's very comfortable.\\nThe only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star is because I was a little disappointed at the cleaniness of this place the second time I went there. I figured there was a kid sitting in our booth before us and the floor and seats were full of crumbs and very dirty. Seriously? the booster seat was still under the table...\\nOther than that, this place is very good, definitely worth a try.\"b\"My husband and I came here for lunch and the wait was pretty long so we opted to sit at the bar.  The service was ok, it seemed the waitress was trying hard to get the food out, but it being the bar it wasn't as fast as it usually is. \\n\\nI ordered the 4-cheese ravioli, and I LOVE cheese ravioli at restaurants...and I get it, its supposed to taste like cheese but this ravioli was so overwhelmingly cheesy that you couldn't really taste the sauce or anything else! My husband ordered the baked ziti and while it was good, we've had better.  The bread basket was cold and hard but the next basket was a little warmer. \\n\\nThe drinks were mixed here mine was pure vodka (but its Vegas right?..I can't complain!) but my husbands was a little watered down. \\n\\nAll in all it was an ok place, but there is better Italian food to be had.\"b'This place has really good Italian food for amazing prices, considering it\\'s on the \"Strip\". I had the Crab and Shrimp Cannelloni ($15) which nearly brought a tear to my eye because it was so delicious. The pasta was made fresh and cooked perfectly, the sauce was fairly rich (made from Asiago) and creamy, and the contents of the cannelloni were superb. Washed it all down with a Peroni on draft. \\n\\nThis may be a chain restaurant but you\\'d never know it. Will definitely be coming back!'b\"We love Maggiano's!!!  They have a great happy hour during the week and the bar area is relaxed and quiet.\\n\\nThere is an old man who looks like the Six Flags guy walking around playing violin and he is the coolest old little dude ever!!\\n\\nOur favorites are the stuffed mushrooms, spinach salad (amazing dressing), and the tortelluca dish.\\n\\nEverythig we have every eaten here is tasty.  You can't go wrong!!\"b\"Ok, I love this place! I wrote a review for Maggiano's a while ago stating that it was just ok ( that was a location in California). But this Maggiano's is really good. Whether going in for a drink and some appetizers, or ordering a full dinner, you will love the variety and taste of the Italian food.  Plus, it overlooks part of the strip! Fun!\"b\"My family &amp; I went to Maggiano's to celebrate my daughter's &amp; nephew's 13th birthday. It was crowded but we were seated within 10 minutes. Our server was very prompt and informative. I ordered a bottle of Chianti and the price was very reasonable. I had the Shrimp and Crab Cannoli and it was soo delicious. Everything we ordered was great &amp; we will definitely be back!\"b'Horrible. The rudest staff and establishment I have ever dealt with. I booked my reservation a few days ahead of time for 7:45 pm. Due to Las Vegas traffic and a double overtime basketball game I attended, our party arrived at approximately 7:55. I checked in to the front desk and said hello. To which I was not greeted and immediatly asked for the reservation name. I provide the name and am told that due to my lateness, keep in mind I am 10 minutes late to a reservation at a restaurant, they marked me as a no show and notified the yelp reservation site. At this point I am already annoyed, but I am on vacation and starving so I state the reason for my 10 minutes of tardiness. I continue and ask if we  can get another table. The \"greeter\" says I will have to wait at the end of the line for an hour to two hour  wait . I am still calm at this point and oblige to stand and wait. A minute passes and a heavy set supervisor type asks my party to move from the desk area. We move over to the corner by a coat rack. Another minute passes, the supervisor again states to move away from the coat rack area also. With my patience drawing low, I move over again to another open spot in the corner. After a couple minutes the supervisor AGAIN states to move away from this new spot. Not once does he show us another place to stand, nor does he say please or  thank you or anything but move. Rather, he comes off as annoyed at the fact that we are occupying space and breathing within the reastaurant. Finally, we have had enough and call the manager . A \"manager type\" scaddadles over after about 15 minutes and says whats wrong. We tell him the situation and he coldly replies that he is busy and the we missed our reservation time. Also so, he has no suggestion as to where to stand and wait in the restaurant. We left. Ridiculous service by a faux Italian establishment that has not the slightest idea about Italian culture, gratitude or hosting. They are obviously solely interested in getting you in and out as fast as possible. You are not a customer to them, you are another number to stuff with chef boyardee noodles at $20 a pop.'b'I have been here many times, and each time I have been impressed with the restaurant and all it has to offer. The food here is fantastic - I highly recommend the flat breads or caesar salad for an appetizer. Also, you are missing out if you do not order the four cheese ravioli. If you come to the restaurant with a large group, they have a great family style option. However, this option is ONLY AVAILABLE for groups of four or over. Do not waste your calories/money if your group is smaller than this - it is not worth it, and you will have to take food home.'b\"It's a national chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. But, the good thing about higher-end chain restaurants is that they're consistent. And, in the case of Maggiano's, they're consistently good, for the most part, and a good value.\\n\\nMy wife had a gift card to their family of restaurants, which included Chili's and Macaroni Grill. Naturally, we chose the best of the lot -- Maggiano's. Located in Fashion Show mall, it's a pain to find the entrance. Walking through the mall, you have to actually walk outside of the mall towards the Strip and head to the second level via the outdoor escalators to find the main entrance.\\n\\nThis was a family outing for us -- our three year old son in tow -- so we were happy to be seated at a booth. They've got a kid's menu with the usual stuff (pizza, chicken fingers, mac-n-cheese, etc). For $5.95 kids get an entree, beverage, and a dessert (lemon cookies or vanilla ice cream). My kid opted for the pizza. It's a long, rectangular, crispy cheese flatbread pizza cut into triangles. Tasty and large enough for two kids to share.\\n\\nThe lasagna was the best item of the night. A huge brick shape filled with crumbled meatballs and Italian sausage and covered in meat sauce. The gnocchi also came in a large portion, good enough for two people. While it was a little too dense, it was a passable version of the dish that came with spicy Italian sausage and a creamy (oversauced) vodka sauce.\\n\\nThey have small dessert options for $2.95. The chocolate cake was decent. A little too cold and firm, but it hit the spot. We also opted for the lemoncello pie ($7) -- essentially a circular key lime pie with cherries garnishing the plate and topped with whipped cream and almond slivers.\\n\\nWhile not the best Italian food in the city, Maggiano's does make for a good family restaurant at a decent price, considering its location.\\n\\n3.5 Stars\"b'WOW is all I can say!! Great food definitely didtinctive in their own way and yes the stuffed mushrooms are as good as everyone says they are. Thanks yelpers you did good on this one!'b\"4 +.   Yes, it's a chain &amp; pretty much the same in all their locations, but it is just so damn good.  (PSST  there's a $10 off $30 purchase coupon available on their website) \\n\\nWe were seated at the time on our reservation and treated to very attentive service.  The house chianti was good.  Bread was served soon after we were seated and waiter was kind enough to bring out some red pepper flakes and Italian herbs that we could add to the olive oil.\\n\\nThe waiter explained that they were no longer doing half orders &amp; I thought I understood him to say that the menu had been redone and the portions as well as prices were now smaller.  No matter--the lady at the next table had a rather large platter of food and I was pretty sure we weren't going hungry.  I had linguine with shrimp &amp; garlic  (what, I like red wine with that), and my friend had the rustic chicken &amp; shrimp.  I love that they are not afraid to use the garlic here.  My shrimp were big and cooked perfectly and the sauce enhanced it beautifully without overwhelming the seafood.  And there were leftovers (just as good for breakfast the next day).  For around $16 a plate (before the coupon), it's hard to find food this good in Vegas.\"b'2 stars, because I\\'ve definitely experienced better.\\n\\n\\nI booked a reservation through Open Table. I actually changed my reservation twice because my parents\\' plans kept changing. First I scheduled it at 7pm, then I changed it to 6pm, then finally to 6:45. I got a confirmation email for each change, so it was fine. In my reservation I specifically stated: We would greatly prefer a view seating as we are here to celebrate my mother\\'s 63rd birthday. Did that happen? NOPE.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at 6:45, I went up to the heavy set host/supervisor who didn\\'t even care to greet me and told him I had a reservation that I made on Open Table for 6:45. He clicked around on his computer and said he didn\\'t see and record of it. I proceeded to login to my Open Table account and pull up the whole reservation on my Ipod. I maximized the time, name, and party party size and showed it to him. He scrolled around on the page as if he were trying to find something that\\'d prove me wrong, but there was nothing. My reservation was right there on my phone. He told me \"well, you should really call to verify your reservations\" and I said, \"Oh, does this happen a lot here?\" he said, \"No, that\\'s never happened. This is the first time I\\'ve ever seen that happen.\" As if I made everything up! I tried to explain that I changed my reservation a couple times and that might be why, and he said \"no, that wouldn\\'t be the reason.\" So wtf is the reason then? Not that I care, but he just stood there making it seem as if I forged a reservation on my phone or something. Ridiculous. After a couple minutes of just telling me he doesn\\'t see the reservation and ignoring the fact that it was on my phone he said he\\'ll try and find us a table, as if it was such a huge favor. They took us to the back, as far away from the windows possible and sat us in some table right behind a pillar, so the only view we could\\'ve gotten was then blocked. \\n\\nI was very upset. The whole reason why I chose this place for my mom\\'s birthday is because they wanted a decently priced restaurant with a view. Instead, we got a shitty table in the back of the room behind a pillar that we paid a total of $114 for. I could\\'ve gotten a better ambiance at Olive Garden with employees 5x more polite and a bill half as high. At least the food was good...too bad my appetite was spoiled before we even sat down. \\n\\nTo make matters even worse. I went home and checked my email, only to find that Maggiano\\'s marked me as a NO SHOW on Open Table. How the F*ck did they mark me as a no show if my reservation was supposedly NOT THERE?! 100 points out the window. I had to contact customer service to explain that I was there and take a picture of my receipt for proof, so I wouldn\\'t have the no show on my record. Their response, \"Based on our diagnostics, your reservation was in the restaurant\\'s electronic reservation book, but for some reason this was not conveyed to you. Thank you for making us aware of this discrepancy!\" Hmm, I wonder why that happened?\\n\\nVery upset with Maggiano\\'s and that heavy set host/supervisor man, so much that I don\\'t plan on coming back here anymore. I\\'ll Splurge on Capital Grille instead if I want that same view.'b\"I got there prior to our reservation, so I sat at the bar for a drink, I was ignored for some time, even though there were a few people behind the bar, and the bar stools were half empty, so they weren't busy. Guess they don't like tips.\\nWe had a very large group so they had to split us into 2 different tables. They miss counted the seats and left one out, a friend grabbed a chair and added it to the table, but we still had to wait for extra settings and menus. It took a while to get drink orders in, but water was at the tables already. I got an Arnold Palmer with Vodka, it was on the weak side but tasty. A friend got a Coke and said it was flat.\\n Bread was served with plenty to go around. It was warm, soft and yummy. \\nI got the Italian Salad, it was very average, the italian vinagrette was quite boring.\\nI ordered the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni special, which I have had before, it was very good, lots of crab chunks and shrimp. Some friends got the Chicken Parmesean, the portions are huge, but they loved the food as well. No one at our table had a complaint about the food.\\nMost of us skipped desert. Roving musicians entertained us while we digested and others finished up their sweets.\\nBeautiful atmosphere, our waiter was great, food was pretty similar to most italian restaurants around.\"b\"Great dinner, the portion was huge and I couldn't finish it.  Our waiter was top notch and I enjoyed myself.  Recommend reservations.\"b'The food was so delicious and I love the family style dinning!  The stuffed mushrooms and the alfredo sauce is so AMAZING also the cheesecake is not too shabby either!!!'b'This is literally my favorite restaurant in Vegas. As a true Italian and eating REAL home cooked Italian food my whole life, it is sometimes hard to find a place that can compare to grandma\\'s cooking. \\n\\nThe service here is ALWAYS amazing (I go often.) It doesn\\'t matter what you get, you will enjoy it. I recommend the Raviolis and their house salad (yuuum!) \\n\\nThere\\'s a little \"secret\" that isn\\'t such a secret anymore.. After you are seated, ask for the \"Family Style\" menu. They\\'ll bring you a totally different menu with great prices and it\\'s all \"family style.\" They\\'ll keep bringing you more and more of what you want until you ask to stop :) And I have tried everything on this menu and it\\'s all delicious. I think the minimum you need to get family style is only three people. It is well worth it, I promise.\\n\\nYou gotta try this place! I promise you\\'ll enjoy it!'b\"Went here for a quick dinner before a concert at the Cosmo. Made reservations so we wouldn't have to wait. Seated immediately upon arrival, and by the window at that!\\n\\nGreat service. April was our server and she was awesome and on top of everything. \\n\\nWill definitely eat here again when I am in Vegas next.\"b'Dinner here was awesome. The ambiance , the service, and most of all the food and wine. Just excellent! Portions are def well portioned for the price and the prices are a deal when it comes to [portion and most of all taste! The fresh bread they bring out is also a winner! Try not to over eat on the bread and salad though because the dish itself you need to save room for and also the desert!  The pasta list also gives you options for gluten free or wheat as well for those who prefer. They also have a great alcohol selection and assist you in helping find a wine that best fits your meal that night. Definitely a great spot to eat and you can park inside of fashion show mall so there is a ton of parking!'b\"My hubby took me here for dinner. There was a 45 min wait but well worth it. Nice place, turned out to be very romantic. We had a small table right but the window of the strip. We had someone play a violin for us. The service was great and the food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Don't come to vegas and miss a meal here. \\n\\nVisited September 2011\"b\"Let's make this short and sweet...\\n\\nService - very poor\\nFood - average\\nWill I come back? - NO\"b\"Everytime I am in Las Vegas I would go to Maggiano's.  Everything is great and when my wife and I are there for a Marathon we eat pasta.\"b'I came here for the first time Sept 2011 with a group of 5. Like everyone says, its romantic, has great views of the strip, great service and the food is FANTASTIC. \\n\\nI had the fried calamari and eggplant parmesean and it was the best eggplant parmesean I\\'ve had so far. Everybody else really liked their food too, although I didn\\'t get to try it. However I will be going back. Not to repeat what loads of others have said, so here\\'s my recap:\\n\\nPros:\\n-Really good food\\n-Nice ambiance and views\\n-Easy to get to (Fashion Show Mall), cabs can just drop you off curbside in front of the restaurant.\\n-Surprisingly affordable! For the same cost as going to Bucca or Il Fornaio, this food kicks those places butts! (In my opinion =)\\n-The service was great. Super friendly wait staff and very helpful with the menu.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Not really a place to bring little ones as its kind of a \"romantic\" and quiet atmosphere, but I\\'m sure you could have them here.'b'Wow, we got lucky.  No wait.  Quick service.  In and out in less than an hour.  As always excellent food.'b\"Boy, do I love Maggiano's. \\n\\nMy friends and I came here on a whim while in Vegas after working up appetites shopping at the mall. Probably not the best idea since we were squeezing into tight skirts/dresses later that evening.\\n\\nThe wait was about 20 minutes. Once seated, we ordered one of the family style dinners, which included soup, salad, a few entrees, and dessert--way more food than we expected.\\n\\nEverything was amazing, including the service. Somehow after all that food, we all still had room for dessert. We definitely ate way too much, but hey, we were in Vegas after all.\"b\"The only Maggiano's that has awesome customer service and YUMMY FOOD. One of the smallest I've been to. They do have rooms if you want an event done there. You can only have a small wedding reception up to 60 people no more then that. It's located at The Fashion Mall at the very end of the place. They do have a outside patio. It is a very romantic place with the view of The Strip. The food is so much better the The Olive Garden more authenic in you're face. The food stick to you're ribs. You'll never leave hungry. \\n\\n\\n\\nF.Y.I\\nThis location where you order a glass of wine. They put the wine in a smaller bottle. You pour what you want in the wine glass. But there is still some more I would say 1/4 left in the small bottle you get more for you're money that way.\"b\"Maggiano's never disappoints!  From their soft, yet crusty bread to their house salad with unbelievable dressing, just the first part of the meal is incredible!  I highly recommend the lobster carbonara!  It has tons of chunks of lobster, so it's definitely worth the price!  \\n\\nWe made reservations at 8 and, while they were unable to seat us any earlier than 8, they were very prompt in getting us a table shortly thereafter.  \\n\\nThe service was great and the view of the Wynn was awesome!  Whether you're in Vegas or any other city that offers Maggiano's, I highly recommend this place!!\"b\"I love this restaurant- casual elegant, and everything on the menu is fantastic!  We bring friends here when they're in town and always remind them to save room for dessert.  The service is always great too- love this place and highly recommend it!\"b'You know the Lens Crafters slogan, \"Ready in about an hour\".  I was waiting at the mercy of the glasses gods, not really in the mood to shop, so I decided to talk a stroll to the other end of the mall for a glass of wine.  I considered each of the different restaurant options, but with the main goal in mind, wine, I opted for Maggiano\\'s.  \\n\\nThe rest of the mall was sparse, but you would never guess it was a Tuesday night upon entering.  The joint was hopping.  I found a vacant seat at the bar and grabbed their wine list.  I usually start with a white, but my mood was askew due to the onset of cool weather and early sunset.  After a brief study, I requested a glass of Meiomi Pinot Noir.  Score!!  Now, what to do with my hands while I sit here, but of course, an appetizer!  All of my friends can attest that I\\'ve been on a calamari quest of late.  Not surprising, I opt for the calamari.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m kicking back sipping my savory cherry berry juice, the fellow next to me, a tourist from Connecticut, strikes up a lively conversation.  I discover he works for the Travel Channel, has an exact opposite wine palate from me, and we were both at the same event last Saturday (the Lee\\'s 9th annual Wine Experience).\\n\\nPerfecto!  Little golden rings cooked to lightly crunchy perfection arrive.  Pair them with Maggiano\\'s famous marinara that suggests nuances of garlic, onion, and basil and I\\'m one happy camper who forgot she was waiting on anything.  The Lens Crafters notification call comes and goes, but I\\'m not ready to leave just yet, so I order up another glass of wine.  This time I order up a Cline Ancient Vines Zin, which isn\\'t bad at all.'b'My wife and I like the ambiance of this place.  Its really nice to eat outside on the balcony.  They have decent wines, the food is pretty good, healthy portions and friendly staff.  i recommend this place.'b'We eat here every time in Vegas.  It very consistent.  It is very good for large groups as it serves the traditional large sizes.  Service is always good, food is always good.  My noodles were a little over cooked this time so I knocked them down to a 4 star otherwise they are 5 star all the way.'b'Second time here and first time to review. A friend of ours made dinner reservations for Sat evening by the window and within 10 mins of arrival, we were seated right above The Strip facing the Wynn. My recommendation is to bring 3 friends so you can order the \"Family Style\" meal on the back of the menu. There are three price points and we chose the $30.95/PP. You choose and everyone shares 2 salads, 2 appetizers, 2 pasta dishes, 2 entrees, and 2 deserts. And if you want more, just ask. It is AYCE. :)\\n\\nMy rating is for the \"Family Style\" experience.'b'First time visit. Great view of strip at table. Wonderful atmosphere. Great food. Good prices. Great service.'b'My in-laws love this place so we went for dinner with a group of 8 with their CHASE rewards.\\n\\nFirst of all, make sure you make your reservations really far in advance. They made them a couple weeks ahead of time on a weekend and there still was only a 5:30 or 9:30 reso. if you make a reservation for a large group of people they make you wait for everyone to get there to sit down. This was annoying because the last two in our party were late and we were getting hungry.\\n\\nThe ambiance was really cool! The lighting is nice for a large group or a date. Their service was ok. The server poured the rest of our bottle of wine and then didn\\'t ask us if we wanted another bottle. We weren\\'t finished with our meal so I thought that wasn\\'t very smart of him.... More $$ more tip...\\n\\nThe food was pretty good for a corporate place. Very corporate, like a Buca Di Beppo or a Macaroni Grill but a little bit better. \\n\\nI give it a 4 instead of a 3 because I feel it wasn\\'t just \"ok\". The atmosphere and the singer guy with an accordion player accompaniment really stepped up the review from a 3 to a 4 star.'b\"A solid 4 stars.....\\n\\nThis place was pretty damn good. I know it's a chain and I would have thought I would have been to one by now considering they are all over the place in the DMV area. Surprisingly so, I had not and my first visit to a Maggiano's Little Italy in Las Vegas was a pleasant one. When I arrived they had to tap a keg for a Newcastle that I wanted, this was sort of annoying because it felt like forever but I was watching football (and gambling on it) at the time.\\n\\nOur waitress was a real sweetheart, and she checked on us regularly. I had a few (2) beers before my meal and they didn't seem to mind. The ambiance was really cool, but I could have told it was a chain type restaurant even if I didn't know. \\n\\nThe food was great. They brought out bread before the meal and we weren't very hungry so I didn't order an appetizer. I had the center cut filet mignon and the person I was with had the salmon salad. We were both very pleased with the overall meal. \\n\\nI was very pleased with this chain restaurant and would go back again.\"b'Long line so I expected something spectacular. It was just average Italian food with a high price.'b'Terrible customer service.  We called a month in advance to make Thanksgiving reservations.  We flew in from Philly and flew my brother in...for his birthday....from L.A.  When we got to Vegas, we called to move the reservation an hour and a half later.    No problem, the girl told us...and she confirmed they knew we were celebrating a birthday AND Thanksgiving.  We arrived only to learn they had closed at 8, one hour BEFORE we were supposed to be there.  I confirmed the time I had called, and they confirmed that a note was in our reservation.  Nevertheless, although the restaurant was PACKED, they refused to seat us. They offered a weak apology...not even a free drink....and our Thanksgiving was ruined.  Terrible, terrible customer service.'b\"First let me say I really enjoy the food and atmosphere at Maggianos.  We go there often, but unfortunately, I can't say the same for their Thanksgiving Dinner menu.  We made reservations for 5:00 pm (a month ago) at their Las Vegas location and they did not seat us until 6:15 pm.  I was not happy, but really try to make the best of this special day.  Waiter was overworked, came to our table maybe three times.  I felt like the whole thing was a big rush, did not enjoy at all.  Could have stayed home, cooked and saved the money we spent.  I will go back, but not on any major holidays.  Oh yeah last but not least THE FOOD was mediocre!  I know, I can't believe it!  The best part of that night was leaving.  That comment was from my 7 yo son.  Lol\"b'Well, we come here a couple of times a year when we are in Vegas. Tonight we had an excellent server, Frank. He\\'s a tall \"New Yawk\" boy.\\n\\nWe had several requests throughout the meal, which were all attended to promptly, and with a genuine smile. We really enjoyed the excellent service and sunny disposition.'b'I\\'ve been to Maggiano\\'s before and didn\\'t think that much of it.  However, Vegas Maggiano\\'s may be your \"What should we eat\" dinner place.  I thought it was so worth it paying like $15 for pasta rather than paying the same amount for pho.  Plus, it feels like you can just sit down and chill.  The food is typical Italian chain so you can\\'t go wrong.'b\"We went here the past Tuesday for lunch and I got what I normally order since I am not a fan of pasta, the salmon entree with spinach and potatoes.  The last time I had this was probably last year.\\n\\nWhen my food arrived, I was surprised to find that my potatoes were on a small plate while the nicely cooked salmon, placed on top of bed of spinach topped with capers and lemon and herb butter, was on another.  The salmon was as good as I remembered, but the potatoes weren't the same.  Better!  They used to come on the same plate as the salmon and was plain roasted, nothing unique.  But now, they are nice and crisp and WOW, it adds a different texture as an accompaniment to my fish and I am loving this entree more than ever before!\\n\\nI usually only finish half of this entree but this time around, I finished the entire meal and yes, I was happily full.\\n\\nAdditionally, our waitress provided our party with exceptional service.  Her service is comparable to that of a waitress at Joel Robuchon (I know, bold statement, but she is that wonderful).\"b'I\\'ve been sick for the last week and was soooo sick of liquids and soups that I wanted something hearty. I always somehow or another crave pasta; ALWAYS! So decided to have lunch here and get some Nordstrom shopping done.\\n\\nOther than pasta, I had been craving fish. Luckily, the waitress sealed the deal on my dish when she said I could substitute my potatoes with pasta. So, I got the grilled salmon with lemon and thyme, sauteed spinach (with pasta and garlic and olive oil). \\nIt was sooooo good. Exactly what I had been craving. Fresh and light tasting fish with my pasta fix!\\n\\nFriend had their \"famous Rigatoni D\" which is pretty delicious. Rigatoni and penne pasta have to be my favorite kinds of pasta. Prolly because I hate having to \"slurp\" up the long stringy pastas. And mushrooms and onions added to the ringatoni always make for deliciousness and a happy Laurie =)\\n\\nWith it being cold lately, it was nice to end the lunch with some tea. I think I had some apricot or peach tea and friends had the peppermint tea. Great that they had big tea collection.\\n\\nThe service was prolly the best I\\'ve ever had there. Had to tip the waitress well just based on her refilling my waters like crazy that day. Kept having to tell her that I was really thristy and sorry for always coming back for refills.'b\"Before going to a show, we decided to get a bite to eat at Maggiano's. Though I should say many bites as the portions at Maggiano's are huge!\\n\\nI ordered the rustic chicken and shrimp al forno with a Caesar's salad. It was really good. In fact my mom and her friend liked it so much they wished they had ordered it. The only bad part was I had to go out of town the next day so I wasn't able to keep the leftovers. It worked out great for my mom's friend though, who offered to take the leftovers!\"b'Place was packed on a Sunday night - we opted to sit at a high top in the bar area. Unfortunately we were just inside the door and every time somebody went in or out we got blasted with a strong cold wind.  Service was friendly but pretty slow. The salads were huge and delicious. \\n\\nThe chicken piccata was rather odd - the pasta was served in its own bowl on the side. I did my best to mix it with the chicken.'b\"Had dinner last night with the family and I'm giving them 4.5 stars for the service and the food.  The wait is rather long, that's why I gave it 4.5 and the food is a little pricey.  Our server was very attentive and always smiling whenever she comes to our table, making sure that we have what we need.  I ordered the Lobster carbonara.  It was very good, with lots of lobster meat (it's mostly from the claw).  They have big portions, so my daughter, my husband, and I have to bring home half of our food.  \\n\\nI will go back to this restaurant because of the food and service.\"b\"Always a great choice for Italian, and surprisingly, for being on the strip, they have the best prices in town!\\nI'm never disappointed when I come here.  The food is fantastic, the service is great, and the ambiance is grand, with views of the strip throughout most of the restaurant!\\nI recommend this place with two thumbs up!\"b'We\\'ve always liked our normally pretty flawless dining experiences here.  But on this particular occasion, when of course I was introducing the restaurant to two friends, the wheels of service largely came off the tracks.  We had reserved a booth that overlooked picture windows facing Strip hotels across the street, but it wasn\\'t ready when we arrived.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a booth to be cleared, which was no big deal.  But it established a pattern of service being at least two beats behind all night.\\n\\nFor starters, I ordered Calamari Fritte and Crab &amp; Shrimp Imperial, a special of the day.  I also ordered a cup of Tuscan Sausage &amp; Orzo Soup and a side of Caesar Salad before my entree of Linguine &amp; Clams.  Bread arrived first, which was good and crusty.  But our Iced Teas and soft drinks were not brought forth until 10 minutes after the presentation of bread, EVO, and butter.  And, one soft drink was missing.  So were two of four bread plates and a knife.  \\n\\nSoon afterward, the appetizers arrived.  Unfortunately, so did both my soup and salad.  Four items were plopped on the table at the same time--all of them mine.  Although jammed up with food, I did my best to race through the appetizers before my soup got cold, and largely succeeded by taking half of each appetizer home.  The Crab &amp; Shrimp Imperial, consisting of Crab-stuffed Lobster with Herb Bread Crumbs and Lobster Cream Sauce over Orzo pasta, was simply excellent.  It was also very filling.  The deep-fried calamari was uncharacteristically undercooked, but still fairly tasty--especially dipped in the Lemon Aioli that was prepared on request.  The accompanying Marinara Sauce was also good and mellow.  \\n\\nAs before, the Tuscan Sausage &amp; Orzo Soup did not disappoint.  The fennel-flavored soup packed an unusual but welcome taste of mild sausage, fresh tomatoes, celery, and white beans.  The side of Caesar Salad was a generous helping of cool and crisp Romaine greens with Focaccia Croutons and grated Parmesan Cheese.  Linguine &amp; Clams with invisible but tasty White Clam Sauce was a nice pasta dish that boasted both fresh and chopped clams.  But, unfortunately, only 7 fresh clams were present, which not only seemed meager but were far less than I had enjoyed on a previous occasion.  And, I bit down on a small piece of clam shell that was included in the mix.   \\n\\nGarlic Bread Focaccia was not very garlicky at all.  And, inexplicably, the cheesy Fontina Potatoes that my wife had ordered did not arrive at our table until 20 minutes beyond the third of three promises of \"2 minutes longer\" by our server, just AFTER our packaged leftovers had been handed to us.  Obviously, we didn\\'t want additional starch any more at a point when we were about to leave the premises.  After an apology by our server that seemed sincere, the still steaming potatoes were packaged in a baking tin and presented to us again without charge.\\n\\nThe quality of ingredients and tastiness of what I ate were mostly sound as always.  And, kudos and an extra 1/2-star to restaurant management for calling to report that my missing Kindle had been found on the floor of our booth, before I raced back to retrieve it right after midnight.  So, 3-1/2 stars on an off night.'b'Excellent food and atmosphere. TOURISTS:  if you have leftover food, take it with u and walk to the nearest pedestrian bridge and give it to one of the many homeless there.'b\"I had dinner here with three co-workers last Wednesday night (1/11/2012). The ambiance was nice and the wait staff very friendly and efficient. We ordered the family style dining option and the appetizers were excellent. We have the Mozzarella Marinara, Spinach &amp; Artichoke al Forno, Garlic Bread Focaccia, and Italian Tossed salad. For dinner we ordered Gnocchi &amp; Italian Sausage, Four-Cheese Ravioli, Baked Rigatoni Pomodoro, and Braised Beef Ravioli. The main dishes were overly sauced and the pasta was over cooked. I could not even eat the gnocchi...it was like eating balls of paste.\\n\\nThis restaurant is highly rated by many on Yelp so it is possible we were just there on a bad night but I will find it hard to return after my last experience. I don't think that anyone in my group was terribly impressed.\"b'Great place! Great food!'b\"We hosted our Wedding Reception at Maggiano's Las Vegas. It was the perfect place for our wedding reception! Cassy was extremely helpful and always responded to my emails in a timely fashion. I also appreciated how she genuinely cared that I was getting the most for my money. She made great suggestions about how to spend the money toward our room minimum. The workers at Maggiano's did a fantastic job setting up our reception. It looked even better than I had imagined it would. There was SO MUCH food and it was all delicious! My guests all loved the food and some said it was the best food they had ever had at a wedding. This venue is a one stop shop, they referred me to a great DJ, bakery, florist, and limo service too! Thank you so much to everyone at Maggiano's!\"b\"First time at Maggiano's and Ill definitely be back! I had the skirt steak with green peppercorns for lunch and it was great!! Fries needed some work, hence the 4/5. Server was very sweet and attentive. I will definitely be back!!\"b\"So my bf and I decided to eat here while we were at the fashion show mall. He kept raving to me how good it was so I wanted to try it. And he was RIGHT!! It is absolutely delicious. It's fine dining so of course service was great as well.\"b\"We stopped here at the last minute. Managed to get a table quickly on a busy night. Best to get a reservation if you want to go. Pricing is better than most. The food was wonderful. Everything we ordered, including the dessert, was at least a 4/5 rating. The service was excellent. Friendly and just the right amount of attention without hovering. The view of the strip and the Wynn is a nice taste of Las Vegas. The roving musicians I can take or leave. It's a bit coercive when you are asked if you want a song for your lady in front of her, and knowing that they expect payment.\"b\"i haven't been to maggiano's for about 5 years.  but it still has the same solid food.  \\n\\n*this location is inside the fashion show mall*\\n*they only serve the dinner menu...no lunch specials*\\n\\nwe came for a light lunch at the bar at 1pm.  maggiano's actually fit the bill because we shared the following: a italian toss side salad and an order of spaghetti meatballs.  hubby had beer on draft which came in a tall (but skinnier than usual) glass.\\n\\nitalian toss side salad - we opted for the side salad portion simply because we didn't\\n      want leftovers.  romaine lettuce, arugula, red onions, tomatoes, croutons,\\n      peppercinis with a light viniagrette dressing\\n\\nspaghetti meatballs - rather MEATBALL, no s.  it was a big meatball though. \\n      spaghetti was a smaller portion than expected.  however, it was perfect for our\\n      purposes.  i love to add red pepper flakes in my pasta.\\n\\nthe lady working the bar area did a great job taking orders, serving, etc.\"b'Standard maggianos fare, which is always a good meal for the $. Service and drinks seemed sharper in Vegas than Atlanta where I usually go.'b'I came here a couple months ago during my vacation in Las Vegas. I was skeptical to try Maggiano\\'s out since they were a chain restaurant but I would be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately no locations in Canada (where I\\'m from) yet! This Maggianos is located in the Fashion show mall next to Wynn and Encore Hotels. \\n\\nMaggiano\\'s isn\\'t exactly fine-dining, but it does have a pretty nice ambiance for a family style restaurant. It has full panoramic glass windows around the perimeter of the dining room, showcasing an awesome view of the Wynn hotel and that part of the strip. While we were there, two violinists went around the restaurant playing songs for each table. And to top it off, our server was so kind and helpful!\\n\\nThe menu here is also pretty interesting and worth a mention. Along side the regular a la cart menu, they also have a \"family style\" menu. Basically you choose several items from a predetermined set, and for a fixed price per pereson, you can order as much of any item you want! Its kind of like \"all-you-can-eat\" but for only the few items you choose. We ended up going for this option and ordered the light family dinner that comes with bottomless portions for 2 appetizers, 2 salads, and 2 pastas.\\n\\nMaggiano\\'s Salad : \\nThis salad is literally the best salad I\\'ve ever had! The signature house dressing was a spicy-sweet vinaigrette, and paired with the crunchy prosciutto bits, I could NOT for the life of me stop eating this!\\n\\nCrispy Zucchini Fritte : \\nThe waiter said this was their most popular appetizer, and I can see why. The zucchinis are deep fried in a crumbly crunchy batter, and were irresistible with the cool ranch dip\\n\\nLinguine and Clams with White Clam Sauce: \\nI did not like this at all. The sauce was runny, and tasted like fishy sea water. It was way too salty.\\n\\nOur Famous Rigatoni \\'D\\' \\xc2\\xae :\\n guess they don\\'t call it \"Famous\" for nothing, this pasta is really really good! The pasta is cooked perfectly al dente, and is served with lots of mushrooms and creamy Marsala sauce. \\n\\nFor a chain, this place really isn\\'t bad! You\\'ll leave for the most part happy and full :)'b\"OK. I am not  a connoisseur of  Italian eateries, but I have been to enough  Italian restaurants in my time to give a solid review. First, my friends and I made reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday evening 3 days in advance. We get to the restaurant at 6:55pm and the hostess gave  us the pager gadget and says it will be a few minutes. Half an hour later, we still have not been seated yet. I wonder why we  even bothered to make reservations. In my book, you make a reservation for a certain time and when that time comes,  you get seated. that is the point of making a RESERVATION and the basic meaning of the word. This is a big NO NO in my book. That is either poor planning or mismanagement or both. If I am gonna spend some bills in a fancier style restaurant, I expect to be taken care of. that is what I am paying for and have no problem doing so.  The silver lining ,if there is one, is that we weren't the only ones. there were numerous folks there having the same frustrations and issues with this topic and wishing to speak to the manager. Not a good sign. the waitress was nice enough and adequate though. the only issue I had with her is that we got our vinegar and oil for our bread, but guess what, no bread. only after 20 minutes and asking did we receive our bread. again, not what I expect from a  purported higher class establishment. the food was adequate but not what I would call earth shattering. the calamari was tasty and the Rigatoni D was tasty and sauce was good. I have had better and worse.  my friends all liked what they got from what they told me. Overall, mediocre experience at best.One thing I have learned over the years is that  you can tell a lot about a place by the way they keep the bathrooms and I must say that was horrible and maybe the worst I have ever seen except for a few roadside gas stations in my days. It  was an absolute mess with dirty paper towels, water, all over the floor and overall condition to be filthy. again, I hope they don't keep the kitchen like the do the restroom. I don't even want to think about that.  Overall, not a horrible experience but not one for the books either. In my opinion, Carrabas easily matches and super cedes Maggianos overall for a much better eating experience and price. Oh,  Almost forgot, I will give a 4 or 5 on the overall ambiance and feel of the restaurant.  It was a comfortable and luxurious setting, and decorated nicely but unfortunately, the wrapping on the package was much better than the gift inside.\"b\"The ambiance was my favorite part.  We made reservations around 6:30 pm on Saturday.  The earliest seating was at 9:15 pm.  We arrived at the fashion show mall, parked, and wondered our way out front to the entrance of Maggiano's.  I always love the atmosphere in these kind of places.  I'm not a big fan of Italian food, so don't read too much into my comments about the food.  The Calamari Fritte was a bit greasy with too much oil, but was overall pretty good.  The marinara dipping sauce was superb.  We also had stuffed mushrooms, which were really good.  They were stuffed with spinach and topped with seasoned bread crumbs and served in a garlic white wine sauce.  My fiance and I shared a bowl of Linguine di Mare.  It had lobster, shrimp, clams, &amp; mussels with noodles in a spicy lobster tomato broth.  It was pretty good.  Lots of meat.  Very filling.  A man with a guitar and another man with an accordion serenaded us with a romantic Italian song.  Simply romantic.  We had nice seats facing Las Vegas Boulevard.  We lingered a while after paying the bill, but the server stopped refilling our water.  This bothered me a little.  I was unusually thirsty and could not seem to get enough.  The bill was almost $60.  We had to take an alternate route back to the car because The Fashion Show Mall was closed.  I enjoyed this experience and would go again, but would prefer some place else because I'm not a big fan of Italian food.\"b\"I've heard about Maggiano's for awhile and finally got the chance to eat at one of their restaurants when I was in Vegas for business.  Since there were 7 of us, we decided to order family style...  $31 a head and we choose two appetizers, two salads, two pastas, two entrees, and two desserts, all you can eat!\\n\\nWe ordered the calamari and mussels, chopped and Italian salad, spaghetti and meatballs and linguine with clams (white sauce) the chicken marsala and tilapia, and the tiramisu and s'mores special dessert.  Calamari was great, but I was a little disappointed in the mussels.  Too many white beans in the mix for me.  The salads were good.  Linguine was good and the meatballs on the spaghetti were HUGE! The tilapia wasn't too fishy and was nice and moist and we LOVED the chicken marsala.  Both desserts were great as well.\\n\\nBig points for our waiter, Noel, as well.  He was very helpful, professional, and attentive through our stay.  He encouraged us to eat more and even gave us many containers to take home our leftovers in.  The spaghetti and chicken marsala were still great the next day, as well as the desserts!\"b'When it comes to Vegas restaurants, this would not have been my first choice. There is one near my house and I prefer to eat at places I have never been while I am on vacation, but it was my friends birthday dinner. We had a party of 11, so we had to order off the family style menu. We looked at the menu in advance so we already knew what we would be getting when we got there. We ordered the Fried Mozzarella and Stuffed Mushrooms to start. For entrees we ordered a Lobster Carbonara, Chicken Parmesan, Beef Medallions and a Bow Tie Pasta. We thought we would get one plate of each, but they brought 2 of each, one for each end of the table.  We where well fed. Dessert was my favorite. House made terramissu and Apple Cobbler. Wonderful! \\n\\nOur server was wonderful too. She was very friendly and attentive. Our drinks never ran dry. It was a great experience. =)'b\"Maggiano's is must go and enjoy great ambiance. The service was attentive and the food was delicious!\"b'Family style is the way to go if at all possible when visiting here. Doing this for lunch, however, does have its down side. You will have left overs. Be prepared to take something home and enjoy it the next day.\\n\\nThe place is huge and though I am sure it gets crowded we were able to be seated outside in great weather without reservations on a Sunday slightly earlier than the lunch hour in March.'b'I just love Maggiano\\'s. Not usually a fan of big chains, but I just love them. I have one close to where I live and ate there only because we had been given a gift certificate. \\n\\nWhile in Vegas with my family, I insisted we have a big family meal at Maggiano\\'s. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday night. \\n\\nWe arrived on time, but had to wait more than thirty minutes to be seated. The place was totally packed, so we had to stand, smashed together, in the bar area while we waited. That sucked, and made me wonder why we bothered with reservations.\\n\\nOur server was extremely busy (there was an 18 top in our section), but he did a fantastic job, considering how busy he was, and how many questions and picky orders my family came up with.\\n\\nThe food was fantastic. I ordered the spinach artichoke appetizer and the eggplant parmesan. Everyone at the table absolutely loved the spinach artichoke. However, we prefered it on the table bread, as opposed to the \"crostini\" it\\'s served with. The little pieces of crostini are too small and too hard for the yummilicious, creamy, piping hot, rich spinach artichoke dip. \\n\\nMy eggplant parm was beautiful and delicious. Unfortunately, in total vegas style, it was enormous. A small family could have shared it (I have a big family....haha). It was just perfect. I\\'m not used to whole pieces of roasted garlic in my eggplant parm, but they were delightful little treats to discover here and there. It couldn\\'t have been better, honestly. Four meals came out of it- the one that night, a midnight snack later, my meal on the plane the next day, and my husband\\'s lunch the next day. It was even delicious cold!\\n\\nFor desert, my sister ordered the 5 desert platter. It had tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, apple pie ala mode, and....I can\\'t remember the last one. It was so pretty- and only $9.95. The whole table shared it, and we still had leftovers. I\\'m not a fan of sweets, so I only nibbled a couple things. My sister said it was the best cheesecake she\\'d ever had.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a fantastic night. I remember sitting back for a moment, looking around the table... everyone was laughing, eating, and having a wonderful time.'b\"The food here is always plentiful, tasty, and the service always sublime. If I had to pick a chain of Italian, it's definitely Maggiano's!\"b\"I come to this restaurant every time I'm in Las Vegas. The evening I went it was crowded and the waiter seemed stressed. Even though we had reservations they still made us wait 15 min. They seem to do this every time I come here. The view is fabulous! The food was perfect. It was my birthday so they brought me cookies. The only complaint I have is the restrooms were filthy. Both men and women's.\"b'When we arrived at Vegas, it was late night. We just want to have something simply, not too oily or heavy, and then we found this Italian restaurant within 5 minutes walk from Trump. The environment is lovely. There is a violinist playing beautiful songs from table to table. The food were fabulous. We had crab cake for appetizer. The crab was fresh and delicious. I had sauteed shrimps with risotto and it was fantastic. The rice was creamy but not to soft. Shrimp was cooked just enough. My friend has salmon with pasta. It looked nice too.'b'The atmosphere is alright, and the food is good. Nothing special. But the service is exceptionally terrible. I stopped \"giving it another try\" because I just couldn\\'t take it anymore. It amazes me that a place can consistently have bad service in Las Vegas. No thank you.'b'LOVE IT!! food was delicious.'b\"I'm giving it a 3 because I have had some very good meals there. But today I had their Shrimp Risoto Special and it was pretty terrible. Not inedible. But not up to their normal quality. \\n\\nI know Risoto can be a tough dish, but if you can't make it well maybe you should just stay away from it.\"b\"My wife and I, along with our couple friends, stopped by Maggiano's as we were walking down The Strip. We ordered the Tomato Caprese for an appetizer that was very tasty, The dishes are massive in portion and the food is delicious!. Ordered the mozzarella and it was  delicious. Had the New York Strip Steak and the Veal Porterhouse and split both of them. The NY Strip and  the Veal Porterhouse was absolutely wonderful. It was perfectly grilled and  tender. Remember they  serve nice big portions so please share them.\\nThey always have Sinatra playing in the background.\\nTwo people were roaming playing songs for you.\"b'I had the most amazing time here. The food was perfect, the atmosphere was so romantic and the service was impeccable.'b\"Yes, Maggiano's is a chain restaurant that can be found in most US states.\\nYes, it's just typical, hearty Italian dishes.\\nYes, it gets pretty packed here at this particular one.\\nAnd yes, I had a pretty awesome experience here even though I would have preferred to dine at a Michelin starred or famous celebrity chef's restaurant here in LV.\\n\\nI joined some of my old colleagues from my previous job here for dinner during the Interop convention. We had a driver take us from our hotel to this restaurant so there was obviously NO parking problem. :)\\n\\nWe had a table reserved for about 6 of us and we were seated promptly. The place was JAMPACKED for a weeknight. But everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and their service. It can definitely get pretty damn loud here.\\n\\nWe ordered tons of different pasta, chicken, seafood and dessert dishes. Everything served family style of course. Everything that came out tasted wonderful. I honestly didn't wanna look like a mcfatty pig in front of some of the executives I was dining with so I kept my portions on my plate pretty small. But when dessert came out...I opted to eat my full slice of cheesecake all to myself AND of course nibble on some of the other dessert plates that were still sitting there in the middle of our table.\\n\\nOur waiter/waitresses were all very friendly. And service was quite efficient.\\n\\nWould I dine at this particular Maggiano's again? Hmmm, well I have about a million bookmarked spots to try out, so I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon just due to the fact that I already know it's standard Italian food. But I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's not that adventurous with other types of food and just want to enjoy their night with a hearty dinner at a well-known chain restaurant.\"b'I clearly have a different opinion of this place compared to other reviews. this was my second visit here. the first being a few years ago. \\nI do not even know where to begin. \\nThe place is wall to wall people. So crammed on top of one another. It is so loud you cannot hear what the other people at your table are saying. The tables are not big enough for the amount of people they seat at them. We were 6 people squished in a table which was meant for 4.\\nOur server may have been new so I will try to cut him some slack. but he did get alot of our order wrong. Our drinks were mixed up, it took forever to get our appetizers, the entrees came pretty quickly. but one was wrong. The dessert was the worst part. My sister brought in a cake for my nephews birthday, and it took nearly an hour before it arrived. By this point we asked that it be put back in the box to take home. \\nThe food was not good. There are so many better options for Italian food. Real Italian food. To me this is on the same level of Olive Garden. The one shining star of the meal was the spinach and artichoke dip. it was one of the best I have ever had. \\nSave your money go elsewhere, where you can have a great meal and a nice conversation. \\nI for one will never go back.'b'We had out-of-town friends who took us there.  GADS!\\n\\nHow I wish we had visited this place on our own!\\n\\nThe grub is great.  The prices are great.  The service is great.  The out-of-town guests were great.  \\n\\nAs usual, my wife continues to be great.\\n\\n\\nThis place is really worth a visit.'b'i would give it 5 stars.... any other time i would give this place 5 stars - because this place )and the bay area, CA one is amazing and have never had a negative moment....\\nBUT when i went 4/16/2012 - this evening - the inside host was absolutely pure rudeness!! first we went in with a reservation (why one makes reservations here - you still got to wait) we were early so that worked out because we got in just about right after our reservation time... when we walked in we were welcomed by 2 host, the girl on the right when you walk in took our name, and we asked her if we could sit outside, she rudely walkie her outside host and told us no seats available, we took our page and as we did I assured with her we would be seated outside, she said yes just wait until its our actual reservation.... our buzzer page and we came inside to thesame host, and she told us to step to the side and wait to be seated, I said \"well be seated outside, right?\" host, \"no, you never said anything about wanting to be outside, if you wanted to sit outside all you had to do was ask the outside host and be seated out there\", here I bit my tongue from yelling or getting loud and i informed he that she never said any of that and that I had mentioned more than twice that we wanted to sit outside and recalled for her how she even called out to the outside host, the host stated \"oh that wasn\\'t me, you must have talked to someone else\" so lets just say this went on for a few minutes, i was VERY UPSET!!\\nwe had to walk ourselves outside and talk to the outside host ourselves to be seated.... our waiter Miguel - took our mind off it, made us laugh and was so good spirited....\\nhe also can carry a couple arm full of dishes....\\nfood is good!!'b'It was my first time there and I have to say that I love the atmosphere. It is very open yet intimate. Our server was awesome and the food is Amazing! The only complaint I have is the tiramisu was well below average.'b\"I normally would've given Maggiano's a 3 star rating, but they earned an extra star for dealing with our pain in the ass party! Long story short, 17 of my closest girlfriends and I visited Vegas. We made the reservation, then made our choices for appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert. We showed up 45 minutes late on a Saturday night. I was having panic attacks the entire way to the restaurant because I WORK in a busy restaurant, and I know the repercussions of being almost an hour late with a party of 18 on a Saturday night. They were very patient, and we had an amazing private room...it was in a wine closet. So fun! Our waiter was awesome. The food was okay...typical Italian (upscale) chain fare.\"b'After walking for what seemed hours(and probably was), my family and I decided to eat here.  It\\'s conveniently located in the Fashion Show Mall...so after a day\\'s shopping and gambling at the nearby Venetian and Palazzo...some Italian food sounded good.\\nWe went around 3PM, so it was not crowded at all.  We were immediately seated and service was prompt.  \\nThe appetizer we chose which was stuffed mushrooms was quite delicious and I would order these again.\\nMy dish was a Shrimp Risotto which wasn\\'t a part of the regular menu, but a special they had.  I thought it was good, but it didn\\'t \"wow\" me.  I probably wouldn\\'t order it again.\\nMy mom had a Beef Tenderloin dish...and because she invariably cannot finish her meal, she offered some to me.  I found the beef to be very good, and in fact wished I had ordered that instead.\\nMy brother ordered a Lobster Carbonara dish which he was disappointed with because they mistakenly did not put bacon in the dish...even though it is listed and most carbonara\\'s should have it.  I got a bite of the lobster in it and thought it was okay.\\nOverall, the meal was good and I would probably eat here again, but would try another dish.  The prices here are not too bad.  About $60 for three of us including appetizer and drinks.'b'Great dinner &amp; great prices for Southern Italian food.  Excellent service from our server.'b'Love love love Maggianos! The service is always fantastic, the food is even better, and the drinks never disappoint. The patio has a nice little view of the Wynn and the strip. Maggianos never disappoints!'b'We made reservations for Maggiano\\'s through Yelp...and it was so fast and easy!  I would highly recommend making reservations through Yelp, if it has the option.  I believe it was linked to Foursquare?? Not sure though.  \\n\\nWe took my mom out for a late Mother\\'s Day dinner.  It wasn\\'t crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  While, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  My husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  The glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  It was gross.  He told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  He gladly switched it out.  \\n\\nWe went with the family style \"classic\" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts &amp; 4 entrees.  We got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  The ceasar and spinach salad.  The chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ meatballs and gnocchi w/ italian sausage.  Spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  My favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  I didn\\'t care to much for the salmon, though.  The portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  I didn\\'t understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  Maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  The waiter was nice and service was quick.  View is nice...oversees the Wynn properties.  There is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which I believe you have to tip him. \\n\\nIt\\'s a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving Italian food.'b'After extremely abusive service at Maggiano\\'s tonight, I\\'m calling it quits. The food was burned and the server was so rude that we didn\\'t feel comfortable with the scene that we thought complaining would have caused. It went sort of comical at first, but the longer the service continued for, the more abusive it got until it was downright hostile at the end.\\n\\nIt all started with drinks we ordered at the bar; the hostesses told us it would be a 20-25 minute wait, so we ordered there. Our table was ready in 10, so we settled up at the bar (the bartender was incredibly nice, btw) and took he drinks to our seat. The waitress was clearly agitated that we already had drinks and said she didn\\'t bring us bread because we might have just gotten that at the bar too (you only get bread with dinner, so that was a very clear dig). My girlfriend said \"are we being punished for having drinks already?\" when the waitress left the table, and it was obvious we were. \\n\\n She paid attention to the table\\'s around us and didn\\'t even make eye contact with us. She finally asked about the food hallways through our meal by saying \"it\\'s good, right\" while looking at the plate of burned cannelloni that was sitting mostly uneaten (I\\'m posting pictures). When a server asked a question like that as brusquely as she did, she sin\\'t looking for the truth, so I kept my mouth closed while my girlfriend said her dinner was fine. She asked us if we wanted desert or more drinks and when we said no, she plopped down our dirty plates back down at the edge of the table and stormed off to get our check. She dropped it at the table and that was the last we saw of her.\\n\\n We talked it over while trying to make change between the two of us and left her a 10% tip. I don\\'t believe in less than 15% typically (we left the bartender 30%), but she was so rude I think that I should have left nothing.\\n\\n  I used to take people here all the time (and it was recommended in my Las Vegas list) because the atmosphere was nice, the view is great and the food was reliable. Lately, none of that has been true and I\\'m done trying to weather out a bad time at Maggiano\\'s. I\\'ve been to this location 5 times in the last year (I\\'m the duke of checkins here on Yelp), but tonight will probably be the last. Disinterested service I can overlook and even incapable service is something I\\'ll suffer through for decent food or the right occasion. I\\'ve learned my lesson tonight though; there are too many better places that are only a stones throw away.'b\"Pretty dreadful service one afternoon recently for lunch. I really hate when servers decide whether to give good service to tables on whether they think the customers will leave a good tip. Our water glasses sat empty for over a half hour while our waiter filled other tables' glasses and avoided eye contact with us. He delivered our salads and then extremely awkwardly reached over us to get the remaining place settings. I understand that might be a corporate policy but why would you set food down, ask if you can get anything else (usually a good indicator it is okay to start eating) and then reach over your guests? Wrong order of things, weird waiter. That was the last time he visited our table before we were finished, leaving our salad bowls for our enjoyment. I also had a discount that said nothing about not being valid on weekends but they would not honor it. The other staff was not super friendly either, so I did not feel that complaining would elicit a response.\\n\\nThis was a one star experience overall but the food is truly amazing here that I have to give them two. They also had the large lunch menu displayed outside the restaurant when they were not serving their lunch menu on weekends. What a weird day at Maggiano's.\"b'Came here for an early dinner around 5 pm.\\n\\nwe got seated within 2 minutes\\n\\ndrinks and appetizers came quick, we got the\\n margherita flatbread was good\\nstuffed mushrooms eh was not good\\n\\nThe entrees were huge but took 35 minutes after appetizers to come out, at this point we were full and packed most of it to go.\\n\\nbaked rigatoni really SALTY!!! and i didnt like the paprika in my pasta\\nshrimp fettecini alfredo nothing special\\nlinguine and clams was decent\\n\\nThe service was average.\\n\\nI would come back and get outdoor seating and just order appetizers and drinks\\n\\nim still looking for a good italian place in vegas'b\"First, the good part: waiter and manager were very receptive and friendly and tried their best to help. Also, decor and space is fine-- clean and open, what you expect from an upscale chain. \\n\\nThe bad part: the salads we ordered looked like a pre-made salad that you can buy in a bag at the supermarket. The first time it came out there were wilted pieces and they forgot to add the chicken. They were very apologetic and brought out new salads. This time they came out without wilted leaves, but still the produce was as dry and brittle as the first time. The chicken was also overcooked, dry. Maybe I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't a $13 salad. I didn't expect anything fancy, but I do want carefully prepared and fresh food. \\n\\nWe then wondered if maybe it wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but of their food suppliers--the cost of being a chain restaurant. But then we went across to the street to the Wynn and had a delicious, vibrant, salad. \\n\\nSo though I appreciate Maggiano's eager and friendly service and pleasant decor, I think they would do better to focus on the quality of their food.\"b\"Maggiano's is well umm I guess just another chain restaurant in the Brinker International group alongside Chili's. The food here always tastes good though and it's way more nice than a Chili's (trust me...I used to work at a Chili's T_T). I really enjoyed the violinist that walked around the room playing guests favorite song. I share the shrimp scampi and it was okay. Nothing too stunning or extraordinary in my senses.\\n\\nGood service, clean tables, tidy restrooms and prompt service.\"b'Overrated.  Ugh.  \\n\\nI have eaten at Maggiano\\'s a couple of times and I have NEVER had a good experience.  It was the same story both times - they tend to serve customers based on who looks like they\\'re ballers.  I guess that means I don\\'t look like I\\'m not balling out of control, because I always have to practically beg for a drink refill.  It makes me wonder what it is that makes them classify people that way... I was dressed in nice business attire... so did I look like a redneck or something?  Was it because I was young?  Either way, the Maggiano\\'s staff needs to wise up:  you never know who someone is and how well they will tip by appearances alone.  Just sayin\\'.\\n\\nThe food isn\\'t that great either.  During both visits, my fianc\\xc3\\xa9 and I ended up with pathetic salads, burned or under-seasoned entrees, and virtually no service whatsoever.  Both times, something had to be sent back because it was either made incorrectly or was disgusting.  Pathetic.  Get it together.\\n\\nIs there something I\\'m just not \"getting\" that makes this place so special?  As far as I have seen, the elitist attitude from the servers amounts to jack squat.  They can\\'t deliver on any front - food OR service.  This is another scenario where I really feel like you\\'re paying for ambiance, and as I always say, I can\\'t EAT ambiance.  \\n\\nI know!  Maybe I should go be a baller at the local McDonald\\'s - I could order the entire dollar menu and I GUARANTEE the food would be better than Maggiano\\'s!'b'We had high expectations based on the reviews but were very disappointed. Calamari was extremely salty and overcooked (dark brown). Lasagna was cold in the middle. Seafood was strong flavored suggesting it was fresh.  Paste was overcooked and mushy.  Bread was stale.  Price was way out of range from quality ($100 for two people).'b\"I really enjoy the food here. I ordered to take out because I didn't wanna eat by myself and look all weird at an upscale restaurant...that's just no.\\n\\nService on the take out was quick simple and easy, by the time I got to the cashier, the man was already there, it was a big guy and had a healthy complexion. I was going to receive change but I told the guy to keep it since he was there ready for me.\\n\\nItalian food vs. italian food; Way better than olive gardens old bland food (i'll check them out again though since they did try to change for the better), 5 times better! I only got one dish just to try and check the food out.\\n\\n\\n*Chicken &amp; Spinach Manicotti, full of flavor! Chicken had a natural chicken flavor with slight seasoning, the spinach wasn't overbearing and just helped compliment the dish, texture had a slight crisp and softness to it which had a really fine balance, it was superb in my opinion. Not too salty or dry. The ricotta cheese and alfredo sauce blends in perfectly, although the ricotta was just a tad on the stronger side.\\n\\nI'll definitely be coming back.\"b'We had a great dinner and drinks. The food tasted great.'b\"It's like every other Maggianos, but it's on the Strip  in the Fashion Show Mall which means it's BEYOND BUSY\\n\\n1 piece of advice : MAKE A RESERVATION\\nUnless you'd like to sit at the bar but even then, it might take them forever and a day to get to you. Even though it was busy are service was efficient &amp; fast.\\n\\nProbably won't be coming back to this location since we were in Vegas just for the weekend, plus it was WAY too crowded for my liking.\\n\\nOn the plus: complimentary bread, &amp; splitting meals isn't a big deal\"b'We ate here with a party of 10. The service was great. The food was good. We ordered baked sausage ziti, ravioli, lasagna, and pork chops. It was also a walk away from Ti. They also have a great happy hour for cocktails. I would return to this place for sure!'b\"The best Italian food I have ever had from a chain restaurant!  If you are staying in Vegas, get out of your hotel and take a walk to Maggiano's.  You will need the walk back to your hotel to help digest the fantastic meal you just ate.  I have eaten at Maggiano's a number of times around the country and now I find myself seeking them out when I travel.  If you like calamari you must try theirs.  I think my favorite dish so far is Mom's Lasagna.  Be sure to save room for the Tiramisu or Pound Cake with Caramelized Bananas.  They also have a very good wine list.\"b\"Maggiano's is one of several restaurants in the fashion show mall. Definitely better than venturing into the food court if you have the time. \\n\\nWent here on a Saturday evening they were busy still, my waitress was prompt and courteous. The outdoor patio is wonderful option. The food is yummy with great menu options.\"b'Not nearly as good as all the other maggianos but ok for the area.'b'Great Italian food, very nice location, good white table cloth restaurant with reasonable prices. Friendly staff.'b\"We had lunch here on our first day in Vegas.  The food was excellent, the service was fast and courteous and the atmosphere was really nice.  Nothing was outrageous expensive and although we went there during the day, the view of the Wynn and that end of the Strip was nice.  I was told that this is a chain, but we don't have any in Massachusetts and I never would have guessed... Definitely a great option for italian if you are in town!\"b\"This food was very good the bread they give is yummy don't eat to much of it you'll get full. The fettuccine Alfredo was good the chicken was very tender except i seen a picture here on yelp and my Alfredo had no broccoli,  my boyfriend had the chicken saltimbocca which he said was really good all together it was wonderful good services and not to expensive\"b\"I am very happy with Maggiano's. I had been there before and knew I would love the food, but sometimes restaurants will let you down when they have to fulfill an order larger than say 8-10. Not so here. My party was about 40 people, and the food and service was top notch. From the catering managers to the actual staff the day of, everyone was professional, accommodating, and very warm and friendly. I honestly cannot complain about a single thing. Everything I hoped for and expected was fulfilled, if not exceeded. You should definitely consider Maggiano's for a wedding reception or wedding/rehearsal dinner! You will not be let down.\"b'I would give this place 5 stars..but our waiter..EVERY time he poured me water, he spilled it. Only mine. -__- \\n\\nFirst time was a big ass spill..next one went on my bread..third one went on my meal. Come on maaayynn. \\n\\nBUT THE FOOD WAS BOMB DIGGITY!\\n\\nWent to Maggiano\\'s for me, and 2 other friend\\'s birthday dinner with everyone! They have a nice little family meal which is a ridiculous amount of food. But it\\'s all you can eat. Doesn\\'t really explain much,  but if you have a big group..I would suggest that you get that. (Although we didn\\'t order it..lol) \\n\\nService was pretty good. We got some toasty warm bread (yum) and their butter is so  yums!\\n\\nI ended up ordering the chicken &amp; spinach manicotti. SOOO CREAMY..SO DELIIICIOUS! Comes in 3 decent sized pieces, and I just wanted to savor every bite. \\n\\nIt\\'s really quiet in there..none of the other customers talk, so for the most part, my friends and I were the entertainment of the night. \\n\\nWe were seated in the back right corner, so we are able to see the other hotels and what not. All of a sudden, we see 4 cop cars chasing this white car, and it stopped right in front of our view. All of us got up and it was so intense!!!  The police ripped the driver out of the car and shoved him to the ground. Ohmygah. That was good stuff. \\n\\nAlso, I can\\'t fail to mention..we all got to go boxes and bags..and we took some pictures outside. This was towards the hotels, so away from Maggiano\\'s. My friend left her bag near a trashcan and left her Coach wristlet inside. We were all facing away..when we were done with the picture, she asked where her bag was. We had no idea.. I said to not worry, cause it\\'s just her food..but none of us knew her credit card, iD, and other important things were in it. \\n\\nANYONE could\\'ve taken it! LUCKILY. One of our friends saw 2 homeless men downstairs carrying a Maggiano\\'s bag, and he looked inside the bag and pulled out the food and Coach wristlet! \\n\\nFriend\\'s bf sprinted down the stairs and charged for the guy and said, \"GIMME THAT BAG!\" &amp; the homeless guy was pissed, but gave it back. If it wasn\\'t for our one friend who saw him, we would\\'ve never found it. \\n\\nJust wanted to share the crazy experiences from Maggiano\\'s :] \\n\\nBut I would definitely suggest this place! It\\'s really good. Tried all of my friend\\'s food..and perfecto!'b'Not only was the food amazing and reasonably priced for the Strip, they were really accommodating to our time crunch because we were seeing a show after.  My table had gnocchi, chicken parmesan, eggplant parmesan, and the rigatoni D and they were all extremely good.  The only word of advice is to park in Treasure Island or the Wynn/Encore.  The mall parking is far from the restaurant.'b'The portobello ravioli was delicious an we also enjoyed the house rigatoni! Food and service was wonderful. If you are heading this way for dinner I would suggest making a reservation.'b'Great food, good service. The crab cakes were solid; not Pacific NW good but still great for the middle of the desert. Portions were large so wishing my wife and and I would have split and entree. The Lobster Carbonara was excellent. The bacon and lobster gave the spag noodles a rich flavor.'b\"I actually find it insane that i'm giving a Maggiano's 4 stars but it happens i guess.\\n\\nThis is definitely not fine dining unless you are part of the applebees, red lobster, sizzler crowd.   Not to say the food is bad, it's either good or pedestrian depending on which side of the fence you are on.\\n\\nThe reason why i'm giving this place such a high score is because the service was extremely good.  The food was decent but too salty.\"b'Excellent food for the price and our waiter Ryan was Awesome! Very friendly and great service. Recommend for Italian food and drinks. A winner and ask for Ryan!'b'Pretty much one of the best places in town for Italian food.  If you wanna do some shopping and get some grub, go to the Fashion Show Mall and find this place.  Greatest Lagasna you will ever have.  And their cheesecake is to die for.  Amazing service and the atmosphere is not stuffy but very nice.  Have a large party or want something more intimate, they pretty much do anything for you here.  And they even have private banquet rooms for parties!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!'b'Maggiano\\'s\\n- Its Happy Hour is NO LONGER AS GOOD AS BEFORE (now 3Stars on my book), although still a great\\n4-Star restaurant for dinner.\\n\\nYELPY DETAILS:\\n- This nice mid-scale restaurant is\\nconveniently located on the strip nearby the lively fashion mall district. It used to be my favorite spot for HH on the strip. It has an inviting bar area with a classy bar counter and several bar tables around, with a good selection of drinks and excellent service. But my wife and I just had an unsatifying HH experience there recently.\\n\\n- One early Fri evening inmid-August, mywife and I came here for happy hour again and were disappointed that:\\n(1) They NOT ONLY took away our favorite \"Fried Zucchinis\" from the Happy Hour Food Menu,\\n(2) BUT ALSO, the entire bar menu now contained a grand total of ONLY ONE ITEM, i.e., Flatbread! Luckily the flatbread was delicious.\\n- Well, my wife and I used to bring our out-of-town guests here for happy hour and dinner. The place was almost always very crowded with happy customers in the PAST, especially during its happy hour. But, on this Fri evening (around 5:30pm),the bar area was PRACTICALLY EMPTY, with only 2 tables occupied and only ONE customer at the bar counter! We thought it could have a lot to do with the now VERY LIMITED HAPPY HOUR MENU, our nice and efficient waitress agreed.\\n- Well, one more good point: We were nevertheless pleased that they still give out their best tasting warm bread FREE, which tasted heavenly especially dipped in olive oil/basamic vinegar!\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE for HH:\\n- Due to the diminished value and the \"Empty-Space-Atmosphere\" (on a Fri evening at that!), I\\'d now give it only 3 Stars for HH.\\n\\nOn the other hand, to be fair, just back in March, we brought friends over there for dinner (NOT HH), we did have a fabulous time, with tasty dishes, drinks and superb service! So, we wish that Maggiano Management would do something to bring back their popular HH menu and fill its place again for HH!\\n- Hints: Please put back \"Fried Zucchinis\", and perhaps even add \"Crab Cakes\" to its Bar Menu, which is a GREAT HIT on Schottsdale Maggiano\\'s HH Menu anyway!\\n- Until then, I could still go there for a good dinner, but will not likely go back there just for happy hour.\\n\\nPeterskis, August 2012'b\"Took a recent trip to vegas and after walking around starving me and my bf decided to try out Maggiano's.  The ambiance is beautiful with rich furnishings and amazing views of the strip. Bread is brought to the table with butter, but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that. We started with an appetizer of tomato caprese that was very good, next we shared the smaller version of the spinach salad that was amazing (bacon, pine nuts, super yummy dressing etc), and finally we split a plate of the chicken parmesan that was a large portion, so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box. In total, those 3 dishes 1 water and 1 coke was $37 which I thought was very reasonable. The sever was friendly, prompt and attentive. There was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like. Overall I liked the mood of the restaurant, the romantic feel, delicious food and wonderful service. No complaints.\"b\"So my parents were in town visiting and my dad loves Italian food. We were on the strip and I remembered hearing about this place, so we decided to give it a try. This place definitely has some old world charm, it feels a bit like dining at your nonna's house. In typical strip fashion there were some people in prom style dresses and others in basketball shorts, I love Las Vegas! The place is huge and we were seated in a booth that felt a bit claustrophobic. We tried to maneuver the table a bit, but it was a tight fit even for me, and I am pretty small. Regardless, it was a bustling Saturday night and we were seated within a few minutes and our waiter promptly appeared at our table.\\n\\nOf course we started with the bread and it was delicious. I always appreciate olive oil and balsamic with a warm and chewy piece of bread. After checking out the portion sizes on other tables, I opted for a Caprese salad, figuring I could scavenge off of everyone else's plates. The slices of tomato and mozzarella were quite large, I like mine to be a bit more dainty, but they actually had great flavor and it hit the spot for me. I usually add salt to my Caprese, but in this case it was perfectly seasoned. My husband ordered the Rigatoni D, which features chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions all tossed in a creamy marsala sauce. It was definitely delicious! I appreciated that the chicken had flavor on its own and each element really brought something to the dish. It was even better reheated the next day! My dad had the baked Ziti and it was also well done. It had a great tomato flavor with a hint of sausage. I stole a little plate and also reheated it the next day for dinner. My mom had the lasagna and it was pretty good. I feel like lasagne is a dish that everyone makes at home and isn't very difficult to make, and they had a pretty standard version. \\n\\nI was very surprised with how well we ate and even more surprised to learn that this is a chain restaurant. It made my picky dad happy and I would definitely return. It is not the best Italian food in town, but not bad if you're in the mall or on the strip and want a good meal at a decent price.\"b\"We were struggling with trying to have a good reasonably priced dinner for 22 in las Vegas. Everyplace we called wanted us to rent a private room, order from a pricey  catering menu and guarantee a minimum. Believe it or not, the totals were coming up to almost  FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS  including liquor,  tip tax and service charges.  We decided to have the dinner in our suite at Caesars and have maggiano's deliver. Best decision ever. Ashley guided us through the process and we had tons of great food at a fraction of the cost. They delivered on time, set everything up and left. We even had leftovers for lunch the next day. The food was actually better than I thought it would be. Bread, desert,  salad, entrees, everything was great. Would use this place again.  Total tab was under $500. We spent another hundred at the liquor store setting up our bar. Even if you add the cost of our 2 bedroom suite, we're still ahead. First time I won in Vegas.   Great night.\"b'Eating here created wonderful memories...from the amazing food, excellent service and romantic violinist , we had an evening to remember.'b'Good food!'b'To many, Maggiano\\'s does not qualify as \"fine-dining\" establishment, primary because it\\'s a sort of \"chain\" restaurant, and probably becaues they occasionally offer \"deals/discounts.\"  Nonetheless, my experiences eating @ Maggianos in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas have proven that Maggiano\\'s decor, presentation of foods, service, food taste, and overall dining experience has proven that Maggiano\\'s is \"fine-dining\" for the regular Joe who likes good Italian food w/o having to skip out on a month\\'s worth of eating out because of one really expensive meal :)\\n\\nMy experience @ Maggiano\\'s in Vegas was actually, to a significant degree, better than my few times at the Grove location; our waiter was actually a waiter-in-training, but despite his lack of experience @ Maggiano\\'s, he indicated he had extensive experience at other restaurants.  The first-class service he provided to us, despite his n00b status, indicated to me that Maggiano\\'s did not hire your commonplace waiter who\\'s only job was to write down what you wanted.  Not only was he able to describe to us in great detail the dishes we inquired about, he was also honest about what dishes he tried and would recommend.  Of course, he did press us a bit to order more than just entrees, so he was successful in getting us to order a few appetizers lol But those appetizers were all tasty and worth the price of entry (like $1-2 a person for our table of 8).  \\n\\nCustomizing your entree with a variety of different pastas and sauces, and withholding from certain ingredients is expected @ Maggiano\\'s.  They will ask you how you like things and if you aren\\'t keen on a certain ingredient, the cook will gladly make it to your liking.  This also shows that their entrees aren\\'t \"mass produced\" and  are made-to-order (which is why food takes a bit longer than most to come out).  However, our waiter also promised us that the pasta served was made-on-site and fresh daily, thus enforcing my belief that Maggiano\\'s is a high-caliber restaurant.\\n\\nFinally, one of the best parts of my experience eating @ Maggiano\\'s is the fact that our waiter was extremely friendly, able to hold conversations and joke around with the group, and also treat us almost like a \"valued\" and welcomed patron of the restaurant.  Yes, we were eating during lunch/daylight hrs and it wasn\\'t too busy, but our waiter made the extra effort and it definitely showed.   \\n\\nCost for entree &amp; appetizers shared @ the table: $16-20 out the door. For Vegas, that\\'s a great deal for a sit-in restaurant with some amount of class and zero strippers/half naked individuals :)\\n\\nI will definitely return to Maggiano\\'s LV and hope to duplicate this prior positive dining experiences.'b\"Too dark booth for our party of 5 began a disappointing dining experience. Caprese salad &amp; Proscuito Bruschetta appetizers. Caprese w flavorless mozzarella.  Our pasta main course was undercooked, although every dish had sat under the heat lamps/salamander too long. So, tough ravioli, penne (wheat) undercooked but meatball was pretty good. Since we were guests, we did not send anything back. I guess it's just difficult for a well established and popular restaurant to consistently produce good food. But that just doesn't make any sense does it?  What makes more sense is that they get so many customers they'll likely never see again, quality doesn't matter. Good thing there is Yelp.\"b\"Food was great; staffs are friendly, very pleasant ambiance. Our banquet managers Beth and Sabrina helped us on planning the event -We were 300++ miles away from them, and I didn't have a problem communicating w/ them - they will always respond to my questions (email) about the event planning. \\nThey allow us to bring our own microphone, centerpcs and even decorations :) to complete the picture! 4 stars because we only have 1 staff (Javier) helping us - he is very courteous and gracious to attend all our demands, however, it always took him time to come and serve another guest.. Mr. friendly - Manager came to the rescue - apologize and make it up with us :) ..--\\n\\nBit of advice - the patio -is a little loud so if you are planning to have a solemn or event that needs a quiet environment you should choose their indoor banquets.\\n \\nOverall, salute to Maggiano's - for making our wedding reception, a memorable one..\"b\"Maggiano's is both my husband and my favorite Italian restaurant to eat at.  It is amazing!  Fresh, flavorful, good portion size, reasonable prices and a fantastic atmosphere (dim, energetic, but not overly loud).  We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  Staff is awesome.  Only downfall is without a reservation, you will have a wait (sometimes even with one).\"b\"For finer dining in Las Vegas, my wife and I typically like going to Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris, which is excellent. Of course, we can't possibly eat there all the time, so during our last Las Vegas trip we also tried Maggiano's Little Italy. I understand this is a national chain (one which I wasn't aware of at all up until now), but if you didn't know that you would assume this was a single independently owned restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice, but not pretentious. Service was rapid and very personable. Like many Italian restaurants, especially on the strip in Vegas, this place is fairly expensive, but if you do not go crazy on drinks and appetizers there are several reasonably priced entrees on the menu. Our bill with tip was under $35, which is very reasonable for the large portions we received, as well as the quality of food and service we experienced. We experienced no real negatives, and the view outside of the Vegas strip while we were dining indoors was spectacular. They also have outdoor seating, though it is limited in the number of available tables. One minor complaint is that they could turn down the air conditioning a notch, but that is a common complaint anywhere indoors in Vegas, not limited solely to this restaurant. We've experienced much colder air conditioning elsewhere in Vegas. They also did not serve butter with there bread, but brought us some butter promptly when we asked for it. Their to-go boxes are of high quality and very usable aluminum. Portion sizes were large enough for us to have leftovers we ended up taking with us on our flight back home. My daughter ended up eating that, and she was very impressed - even though the food had just been reheated in a microwave, instead of more properly in an oven. For the price, this is a well located and enjoyable Italian restaurant. It is well worth checking out in comparison to some of the more outrageously priced (for Arab sheiks?) Italian restaurants on the strip.\"b\"This place is amazing .. My husband and I went there for a dinner date and it was magical ..the staff was really friendly ...and the food was delicious and in huge portions ...i couldn't finish my pasta (( and i'm an eater )) hehehe..i just love it.\"b'Extremely overrated and not impressive, at all. \\n\\nI went here for a business lunch and I arrived a bit early. The hostesses were very rude, rather than nicely say we\\'re not open yet, they had an attitude that was like go the **** away. Not a good start. \\n\\nWhen I finally get in I head to the back where yes, they have a screen setup and a sound system. But the projector is being leveled by paper towels and was amateurish at best. And the room we were in needed paint. Seriously, when you take a look around the podium was chipped, the walls had chips, and I\\'m thinking for a place overlooking Las Vegas Blvd that the experience was downgraded. It may have been classy a while back, but the management team needs to consider investing in a little bit of paint. \\n\\nThen we get to the wobbly tables, and the family style food that was brought out. Family style might work in Italy but this is America, and to me family style is a masquerade for a kitchen that is too slow or chokes at cranking out high volume high quality plates. In this case about the only thing good was the Caesar salad as it\\'s hard to muck up a Caesar salad. But the rest of the food? Truly unmemorable. If I was a tourist and I walked in expecting the place to live up even partially to it\\'s \"Little Italy\" name I would have felt like I was the victim of a mafia shakedown. \\n\\nLong story short Yelp may have this place ranked at 4 Stars, but there\\'s not enough wine in Italy that could make me intoxicated enough to give it anything over 2. And that\\'s only because I\\'m trying to be diplomatic about it. Needless to say if it wasn\\'t for business functions I won\\'t be back. \\n\\n(Note to staff: It takes money to make money. Investing in simple, functional equipment and PAINT is a start. Next, they\\'re called SPICES. Surely in the recipes that are used there\\'s a line or two for various spices. Your food was barely 1 notch above cafeteria food, no wait, I think a high school aged line cook at Golden Corral in Amarillo Texas could prepare better food than what I had.)\\n\\nYou should be ashamed to slap the word \"Italy\" anywhere near your doors. I better stop typing before I end up clicking on just one star instead of two.'b'The service was exceptional and the food was OUTSTANDING...I always try and eat here when I am in Vegas...FYI-I am a VERY picky eater yet they always have something I like and they are ALWAYS willing to make whatever I like if it is not on the menu!! Will go again when I am back in town!\\n\\nPS-I booked my reservation online while I was sitting at the LV Speed Way watching drag races...such an easy, and perfect thing to do..they had my table ready and waiting for my dad and I =)'b\"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants period!...but here is the skinny on Maggiano's, I had the opportunity to eat here with a small group and a large group and you would think the experience would be better with a smaller group....think again, the menu is different and you definitely know you are eating at a chain restaurant. Food was heavy loaded with sauces and it's obvious there are lots of can openers in the kitchen.   Now believe it or not when you have 15-20 people they serve a family style dinner and the food is a higher quality and the good pasta's, the sausage &amp;pepper appetizer is great! But the most impressive is the deserts...what a presentation! and delicious.  There house Chianti is great for the price, I highly recommend it. \\n\\nThe service is also much better with a larger group....go figure.\"b'What a great menu, excellent service too. Would recommend the family style for any group over 6... We were able to try a little bit of everything. Everything from the chicken to pasta to seafood was great! I am used to NY Italian, and this place was very good in comparison.'b'never and ever'b\"So I came here with a bunch of friends as our first group meal for a bachelor party weekend on a Friday night. We were all starving to be honest and this place had been set up as our go to stop. We received a number of pre-ordered dishes family style that were already included in our costs so I am not sure what the breakdown was, but it was AYCE and we definitely enjoyed the grub.\\n\\nWe had about 30 guys and took over a gigantic table next to a bachelorette and her party and a bunch of normal patrons. We had multiple courses and the food came out hot and tasty and in portions big enough for our entire table to get enough to eat at once...\\n\\nPro Tip: Call ahead and get a reservation. A number of people had to wait quite a while in order to get seated who didnt.\\n\\nThe food was all decent to tasty and the chicken and pasta dish stuck out as the best to me. It had some type of a white (creme?) sauce with it. The dinner also included appetizers and dessert. It's a tremendous amount of food and the only way to go if you dont want to hit up the buffet's.  \\n\\nThe one thing I will add is that the service is not exactly the best. It took several requests before anyone brought us water or drink refills (soda, tea, beer, etc). It was also a bit difficult to get additional bread n butter. It just seemed to take an inexorably long time.\\n\\nOverall it was worth it and our service could have been affect by the sheer size of our group. It is hard to say for sure.\"b\"I am over the moon about this place! I've been here a number of different times and they consistently deliver. The food is so authentic but you can count on a tasteful spin to your traditional Italian dishes. My mom recently ordered the chef's special rigatoni and for once in my life, I saw her finish ALL her food. I have the shrimp and polenta and it was OFF THE HOOK yummy. Perfectly crisp and infused with an amazing lobster bisque sauce. To top of it off, they have the best soundtracks playing in the restaurant. Huge fan of this place and most definitely coming back.\"b\"SO GOOD\\n\\nWe came here after an extremely long day and everyone left stuffed and happy. They told us everything is made from scratch, so they will accommodate any substitutions.\\n\\nWe started with the Calamari Fritte and the Stuffed Mushrooms. I hate mushrooms, but everyone else said they were the best they'd ever had. \\n\\nI had the Chef's Favorite Famous Rigatoni D (without mushrooms of course) and it was crazy good. Anything with caramelized onions is good by me. My bf got the Lobster Baked Tilapia and we were really amazed at the generous amount of lobster on top. He was in heaven! Our friend got the Gnocci and loved it, my parents both got Parmesan Crusted Tilapia and were going crazy for it. \\n\\nI've done the Family Style dinner before and it's definitely worth it. The only reason we didn't do it this time is because we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room.\"b'We were in Vegas for a week.  We happened to walk by Maggiano\\'s and my husband decided he wanted to try this.  We did show up on a VERY busy Friday night without a reservation and we were ok with that.  They only had space at the bar, we were ok with that. \\n \\nWe placed our order and I had asked for lemon with my water.  As she was busy, I waited and waited and waited.  Finally asked the bus boy for some lemon and he brought it almost immediately.  She \"happened\" to walk by, saw the lemon and said \"Oh, you got your lemon?\"  I told her that the bus boy had brought, her response \"Yeah, I asked him to, just checking that he brought it.\"  WTF?  She lied!!!!!\\n\\nFrom when we sat down to when we were served our appetizers, an hour had gone by.  When we asked the waitress about our appetizers, she became a  little aggressive and said she was doing the best she could.  When we finally got our appetizers, we asked her to bring the main course as soon as possible, didn\\'t know how long we would have to wait. \\n\\nFood not bad but certainly not impressed with the waitress.'b'Best Thanksgiving dinner!!!  Misty made our evening so pleasurable!\\nPreset menu...family style...had lots to eat...even brought left overs for the next day!  Yummy!!!'b\"Had lunch at Maggiano's in the Fashion Show mall. It was a nice setting with an outdoor area. We sat indoors, but we had a great view of the Palazzo hotel. Overall a gorgeous window view.\\n\\nOrdered the veal scaloppine piccata style and an Arnold Palmer. The veal scallopine was flavorful, especially with the pickled capers that had almost a tangy sensation. There was also spinach placed at the bottom of the veal. It was a light bed of spinach and I felt that I could have benefited with a bit more. The dish came with a side of angel hair. As for the drink, it was just your typical Arnold Palmer, half iced tea half lemonade.\\n\\nOur server seemed really versed with the various menu items and the ingredients. At first I thought it was only our server and his personality that made him a great host, but after listening in another table it seems all the servers are well-trained and sociable. I applaud the servers for their knowledge and service.\\n\\nOverall it was a good experience, but not a restaurant of choice since it's a chain. When I am in Vegas, I prefer to dine in locations that are exclusive Vegas restaurants. I feel as though that would add to the experience versus eating at a chain that is readily accessible in my hometown.\"b'The service and food was excellent!  I was a concierge here in Las Vegas before and have eaten at many fine establishments and I would say that this one is a new addition to the top of my list.  Great classic Italian and a wonderful view of the strip.  We will definitely be returning.'b'The purpose of our visit to Maggiano\\'s was to carb-load the night before the Las Vegas marathon (which two of our party were actually running, the other two were there to support the runners.  And the carb loading!).  We were looking for somewhere close to Treasure Island at a reasonable price, and Maggiano\\'s fit the bill. We made reservations through Open Table and were seated at our scheduled time.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant was quite nice but the tables are soooooo close together, I kept bumping into the guy behind me.  There was a large party of obnoxious loud people, but this tends to be the case at a lot of places in Vegas.  We split the bruschetta as an appetizer, and while it was delicious, for the price I was expecting a bit more.  However, they made up for portion sizes with the entrees!  My eggplant parmesam was posetively massive, but still elegantly served which I appreciated.  Another in our party had the chicken tortelloni\\'s and the two others had the gnocchi.  Honestly, mine was pretty good but I liked everyone else\\'s selections better.  Maybe I just chose something I wasn\\'t in the mood for.\\n\\nThe bill was reasonable for Vegas and the meal served its primary purpose.  However, in comparison to alot of other places, it was just okay, and I wouldn\\'t add it to my \"must visit while in Vegas\" list.'b\"Made a special reservation for my son's 21st birthday party.  The entire family flew to Las Vegas for this event. We have some food allergies and I spoke with the manager upon making reservations that our party of 10 could not order family style.  I was told that they would make an exception and let us order Al a Carte and that he would be sure to note it in the reservation. When we arrived they refused and said that they were too busy to accommodate us.   We ended up having to leave and went over to Don Vito's at South Point Hotel and had a delicious dinner that everyone could eat and thoroughly enjoy. Five Stars to the food and Service at Don Vito's!\"b\"Greetings, \\n\\nBEST ITALIAN IN VEGAS!!!  I recently visited Sin City and decided to get a late dinner at Maggiano's Little Italy. I would like to start by saying I've never had better service for a late Italian Dinner in my life.\\n\\nWe showed up at 10:00 and basically shut this place down, but not before we met the server of the century, Jake!\\n\\nThe food was outstanding and it was as if Jake new exactly what myself and my other wanted the moment we walked in.  Hands-down the best attention to detail I've experienced.  \\n\\nIf you ever find yourself ready for a late Italian Dinner, this is the spot!  Ask for Jake, ask him a question and he has a long answer! \\n\\nAs for other highly rated main-stream Italian joints, they have nothing on this place and best part about it, below they have Dollar you call it drinks!\\n\\nEnjoy!!!\"b\"I usually come to Maggiano's if I want decent Italian food. Not anything amazing like you would find in other cities. I have noticed that the only difference of lunch and dinner are the prices but the same portion? Very interesting. Usually the lunch portion would be way smaller but I really could not tell the difference. The party/family style is definitely NOT worth the price. I do admit that Maggiano's is probably not even comparable to Bucca but still they overprice their food too much when I could probably get the same thing at a small family owned business. It doesn't help that it's on the strip. The service is great! Make sure if you go on a holiday or a very busy weekend to make reservations! The portions are great but the quality...hmm....I'm the type that prefers quality over quantity.\"b\"This place is delicious! First time in Vegas and wanted to get some good Italian food. I'm a customer for life now! The food was amazinnnggg and the waiter we had was so nice! He comped our drinks and gave us free cookies at the end. I love this restaurant. You won't be disappointed. The environment is nice and it is a very classy place. Highly recommend!\"b'I was impressed with this Italian restaurant located in Fashion Show Mall. I was not aware this was a chain restaurant until my wife told me. I wish they had one in San Diego, but the closest one to us is in Orange County at the South Coast Plaza. I ordered the four cheese ravioli which came with two sauces, basil pesto and marinara, evenly distributed over the dish. The amount of ravioli was bountiful. I was barely able to finish it and when I did I was really full. My wife had the spaghetti with meatballs which she had no problem finishing.  We tried to eat here again before we left but it was too busy. I think there was an hour wait. And this was on a Sunday night. This is a good sign the restaurant is doing something right since there are plenty of choices at the mall.  The service was a bit slow but the waiter kept us informed on when our meals would be ready. No big deal, we were not in a rush. Even though I am not a big fan of chain restaurants, this one is worth a try.'b\"Overall, I agree with the vast bulk of the other reviewers.  I found the service to be friendly, prompt, and attentive.  My only major complaint was the Chicken Saltimbocca had full-sized sage leaves under the crust on the chicken breast.  Biting into one of these and eating it was akin to eating a car pine air freshener.  Don't get me wrong I LOVE sage (it's a big reason why I ordered that dish) but a more deft hand would have used it to advantage not like an assault weapon.\"b'Loved the stuff mushrooms and crab cakes!!'b\"BEST ITALIAN FOOD I'VE EVER HAD* (and I'm Italian!)\\n\\nEvery time my girlfriends and I visited Las Vegas we would come here at least twice (over a week holiday) to have dinner. I love that the restaurant serves up food family style (read: larger portions meant to be shared among family and/or friends) which is how Italian people serve their meals at home to their own families. \\n\\nThe food is authentic, delicious and the servers always know their s***. I usually go for appetizers (caprese, zucchini fritte, mozzerella marinara)  and a main (ravioli, eggplant parmesan, manicotti). One of my friends always raves about the baked ziti. \\n\\nOne of the best parts is that every time you ordered a main you could get a side of your choice of pasta  (from a list) with a choice of sauce for an extra 1 or 2$. We used to get this to go and eat it poolside the next afternoon for lunch. Cheap (sweet, more shopping!) and delicious!!!! I even brought some home on the flight for friends and family once. \\n\\n*Obviously not counting my relatives home-made Italian cooking. And the food is on par with the food served at Terroni in Toronto, Canada.\"b\"On my last outing to this venerable restaurant overlooking the Strip on the edge of Fashion Show, Maggiano's redeemed itself with a fine repast and picturesque view of Encore.  Our telephoned request for a booth with a Strip view was honored despite the chagrined look of other hopefuls whom the maitre d' had to fend off to preserve our pre-reserved perch.  Golden Calamari Fritte was on point and well made this time.  Both rings and tentacles were lightly deep fried and excellent with great requested Lemon Aioli and mild Marinara Sauce.  Bread and butter were very good, and, as always, a bowl of savory Tuscan Orzo &amp; Sausage Soup sporting Italian sausage, fennel, white beans, fresh tomatoes, and plenty of orzo was excellent.  Where this soup is concerned, to enjoy more stomach-warming, fluid rustic goodness I now always order a bowl rather than a mere cup.\\n\\nA Side Caesar Salad with grated Parmesan and Focaccia Croutons in a creamy Caesar Dressing was excellent.  And, Stuffed Chicken Pizzaiola with Mozzarella, Ricotta, Tropheo Pasta, Pomodoro, Red Peppers, and Pepperoncini was fine once I got to the middle of the chicken.  It was similar to Chicken Cordon Bleu but zestier.  As usual, a side of Fontina Potatoes was creamy and delicious.  \\n\\nThis time we experienced excellent service as Noel, our server, without any prodding, carefully spaced out our meal orders so that the various dishes would not come out of the kitchen on top of each other.  All went well except for me killing one of my favorite Polo shirts with food stains from Marinara Sauce followed by splatters from the Orzo &amp; Sausage Soup.  After treating the stubborn marks with both Zout and Goo Gone, after six washings they still remain.  I will not give up either the sauce or the soup.  But next time I am in their close proximity, regardless of appearances I will don a napkin to protect the front of whatever shirt I may be wearing at the time!\\n\\nFor a chain, this is truly a fine one!\"b'Food was great, however the practice of adding dollars to the credit card bill is not something I appreciate. \\n\\nMy total was 19.40, I noted down 23 on the receipt and somehow I got charged 24.40. Italian mob procedure, eh?'b'Its great place to dine. Classy with affordable prices. The food s wonderful. Will always recommend to everybody to experience the best Italian fine or casual dining.'b'ate here on CHristmas eve - great food great service'b'This is my first time at a \"buyer beware\" restaurant!\\n\\nWhen a customer takes a bite then returns a dish because it\\'s not good, the restaurant doesn\\'t happily take it back... then charge for it anyway. Right? Not normal, Maggiano\\'s - especially for a supposedly established chain upscale restaurant. (It was soggy bow-tie pasta a/ spinach, btw.  Ick. Exchanged for Pizza-Hut quality spaghetti marinara, though they still charged for the more expensive bow-tie - we balked, but they would not budge. Supposedly it came from the kitchen or management, the nice waitress still got our normal 18% tip.)\\n\\nBad taste in my mouth from a bland dish and dirty rotten maneuver. First and last time, thank you.\\n\\nUPDATE: After a whole lot of nudging they apologized and fixed the difference on my credit card.  They also said they were sending a little \"gift\".  Well, now it\\'s been three months and nothing ever arrived.  \\n\\nSo for same reason -- careless lack of regard / seriousness for customer service -- STARS UNCHANGED.\\n\\nThe customer service training at this outfit just is rather careless, and that doesn\\'t feel good.  Very nice people, everyone I interacted with, but they lack common classy restaurant business sense.  Maybe it\\'s Vegas culture and I\\'m used to L.A. and midwest?  I do sense there\\'s a weird thing going on in Vegas service culture.  Anyway, I\\'m ragging on their manners, but two-stars also reflects the quality of food, it\\'s really quite unremarkable.  Interior modern but likewise absolutely unremarkable.\\n\\n(BUT, and this was nice, a guy goes around and sings to your table.  Don\\'t know if that\\'s regular.  Normally would have earned a star for that ;)'b'Upretensi\\xc3\\xb8st spisested, med store porsjoner og god vin. Er spesielt glad i Coppola Diamond collection !'b\"A very pleasant restaurant, Maggiano's had very food food at a medium to high price range.  The steak I ordered was cooked exactly to my request which 9.75 times out of 10 doesn't happen.  Our waiter did seem to push for us to order more food than we wanted though.\"b\"Simple chain restaurant with family style feel.  \\n\\nI've been to Maggiano's a few times and found the food very consistent.  I would recommend grabbing a reservation in advance of going here as it gets very busy.  Rather than comment on all the dishes we had, I'll just generally say that everything was well cooked, flavorful, and something I would order again.  As for the service, it was also excellent.  The menu is affordable and the service is great.  Of course there are better restaurants (Lavo, Nove, etc.), but not in this price range.\"b\"Maggiano's is consistently above average and this outpost in the Fashion Show Mall is no exception. The waitstaff was very attentive. We were also able to take advantage of their buy one pasta dish take one home offer. What a great value!  Thanks FourSquare :)\"b\"This is my fourth visit and the food and service seem pretty much consistent.  Ordered the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my main course I had the spinach and chicken manicotti.  Fortunately, I also got to try the linguine di mare and the chicken parmesan that my party ordered.  They were all delicious but the manicotti has to be my favorite.  \\n\\nThis is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions, so it's definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping.  Be sure to call in advance otherwise you'd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated.  Ask for a table next to the window with view of LVBlvd, not one of the best, but still a pretty sight for you out of towners.\"b'Service is great and the food is super good! One of my fav Italian restaurant!'b\"Wonderful service.... I have been there before and have had a tasty Rock shrimp lemon butter garlic pasta that was to die for. However this recent visit, I think I got an off night or just ordered the wrong things. It was all good with the exception of the items being a little dry.  Maybe more sauce was needed by chance.  Next time I'm going to speak up.  Because I like it alot and will be back.\"b'i was recently at this restraunt for a birthday gathering superbowl sunday!  and oh my goodness was it delish!  the waiter nick was so helpful (and nice to look at btw)  he really tended to us as we had a lot of people!  i will be goin here again!'b\"Do not pass go, do not collect $200.....go DIRECTLY to Maggiano's!  I had read the reviews about Maggiano's catering to their gluten free patrons and looked forward to our visit.  We were not disappointed.  I asked about a gluten free menu and the waiter told us they didn't have a menu, but almost anything on the menu could be made gluten free.  They even offered to coat the chicken in potato chips and pan fry it if I wanted chicken parmesan.  Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming.  To make our visit even better we happened to come during happy hour when their signature cocktails were only $6.  YES PLEASE!  I ended up ordering the lobster carbonara and hubby ordered veal parmesan.  All I can say is WOW.  My meal was BEYOND fantastic.  I fully expected tiny pieces of lobster and was astounded when my plate arrived and there were large chunks of lobster.  Both meals were enough for two so we gladly took our leftovers back to our room and had them for lunch the next day.  Hubby's grandmother came straight from Italy and trust me, these meals rivaled hers.  My only disappointment is we don't have a Maggiano's where we live.  Seriously, it was THAT good.\"b'Loved the look and feel of this place...would recommend for a quite dinner with that special someone.'b'I love this place, they have the best Italian food I can find here in Vegas and their prices are pretty reasonable. I always bring my friends from out of town who come to visit here and they always like it. Get your Italian on!'b\"Another night at Maggiano's, and another excellent dinner!  \\n\\nWe started with fine complimentary warm bread and butter in our reserved booth with a window view of the Strip, and moved on to enjoy outstanding Calamari Fritte--excellent tentacles and first-rate golden rings, along with the cheerfully provided Lemon Aioli we had requested to accompany Marinara Sauce.\\n\\nA bowl of Orzo &amp; Sausage Soup was also well prepared and excellent as a whole,  with sausage just tangy enough to make it intriguing.  Although Iced Teas regularly arrived unbidden, I had to ask for butter twice.  It was quickly produced after the second request.\\n\\nCold crisp Romaine leaves bathed in a thin application of a nice traditional Caesar Dressing, and small crunchy croutons dominated an excellent side Caesar Salad.  Belatedly I asked for a single anchovy (semi-health consciousness at work!) and it was duly brought in its own ceramic cup to further enhance this course. \\n\\nGreat cheesy Fontina Potatoes represented a perfect blend of cooked potato slices and Fontina Cheese, and were more than enough to share with Diane.  This time my entree of Linguini &amp; Clams was superb, with a fine light white wine sauce, 9 clams still in the beds of their opened shells, and a generous amount of supplemental chopped clams.  Meanwhile, Diane did her best to attack 3 large medallions of Veal Parm with excellent yummy Alfredo Sauce accompanied by al dente Rigatoni Alfredo.  At meal's end she still had enough food left over for a very satisfying lunch two days later, and we were both too full to order dessert.\\n\\nOnce again I unintentionally dropped and left items under our dining table.  This time when I pulled up on the driveway of my North Las Vegas home, I found that both a filled pill case and all of my house keys were missing from my coat pocket.  After a call to the restaurant and a check under our former table by restaurant management, all items were found.  So, for the second time in 13 months after dining here, I headed back to Fashion Show Mall, and retrieved my dropped items from the check-in desk.  They had been found on the floor of the same booth where my Kindle had been inadvertently abandoned on a previous visit.  So, in the future I either have to avoid this particular booth or take better care of my important personal possessions.  I think I will concentrate on the latter course of action!\"b\"Sticker. Sticker. Sticker.\\n\\nSticker shock when I saw the bill!\\n\\nThank goodness it wasn't my turn. Lol. \\n\\nEverything was good. It's in a decent location, to where they can change you premium solely for location, but it's definitely a delight. \\n\\nEverything was delicious. The service was exceptional. \\n\\nWould definitely dine again.\"b\"My husband and I ate here the last night of our Vegas vacation. The atmosphere was wonderful. The food...out of this world.  I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were. We would have paid similar to our local Olive Garden only way better and would have had to wait an hour to get a table. I would highly recommend Maggianos.  Our waitress asked if we were having a special occasion and we told her we celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary and she brought us out complimentary dessert with lit candles.\"b\"Oh boy. This was probably my best meal during my stay in Vegas. The food here is breathtakingly good, particularly the appetizers. Get the stuffed mushrooms; you will thank me. The bruschetta is also worth mentioning; I guarantee you'll be asking for more bread to scoop up the abundance of tasty tomatoes. For dinner, I had the chicken marsala which was very good. My boyfriend got chicken franchise which (according to him) was decent. The potatoes and salad that his meal came with were excellent. Our waiter was very sweet. Everything, for me, was truly above average. I hope the Maggiano's in the tri-state are equally amazing.\"b'I heard good things about this place so I went with a friend, it was jam packed there and it took us a bit to get a table but it was well worth the wait. I got the lobster carbonara which I could not get through granted I had a salad and bread, you get a good portion size which is nice. I recommend making a reservation before going here for dinner, there is a reason it is packed, its on the strip and the food and atmosphere are great. Nice place.'b\"What a great spot in Vegas.  It may be a chain, but its run like its an original. Great service and decor.  Food was pretty good as well.  The gf and I got bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms for apps.  Both were great!  For dinner the gf went with chicken marsala and I with the francaise.  Both came with sides.   I opted for the fried potatoes and she for the linguine with garlic and oil.  I threw in a side of broccolini to have a nice lil veggie in the mix.\\n\\nWell 1 - 10:\\napps 10\\nmarsala 7 - salty but good.\\nfrancaise 5 - It wasn't bad, but I have had much better and expected more.\\nling with g&amp;o - 2  No taste at all\\nPotatoes - 7\\nBroccolini - 10 nicely cooked and seasoned in garlic and oil\\n\\nThe menu is very extensive and overall it was a great time with the gf.  I am looking forward to checking out the Maggiano's in north Jersey.\"b\"My friends and I were tired and hungry from walking and just decided to go in here and I'm pretty glad we did. We got seated by the window so we had a  pretty nice view of the strip. The food was good, I ordered the  steak and it was really tender and well flavored. What I didnt like was that our waitress disappeared most of the time and was no where to be seen and also my drink Manhattan, it was a little too strong for me and not like what the waitress described it to be refreshing and sweet.\"b\"Just got back from a wedding in Vegas where the reception was held at Maggiano's. The atmosphere inside is elegant, but comfortable. The private room was perfect in size with a large bar at the front and a balcony overlooking the strip. The service during the reception was stellar. I told our bartender/server about my gluten allergy and she was immediately able to identify substitutions and alternate courses for me that would meet my needs. She knew exactly what to do and made me feel at ease right away. I had an awesome chopped salad to start with that made the other non-gluten free people around me jealous. Then I enjoyed marsala mushroom and chicken gluten free pasta. Oh my God, it was out of this world. I need to go to the Maggiano's and Tampa ASAP to have this again. Finally for dessert, I had the creme brulee, again making everyone around me jealous. The meal was unbelievable!! Kudos to the staff and chef at Maggiano's for making the whole night perfect both for guests and for the bride and groom. I have not visited an Italian restaurant since I learned of my allergy but now I absolutely have to go back to Maggiano's.  If you are in Vegas, definitely make this a dinner spot at least one night of your stay.\"b\"This visit was to celebrate Alicia R's birthday.  The Wonder Twins (aka Terri R and Alicia R) invited me and you know I am not turning down a good meal with the hottest twins in Las Vegas. Besides, it's been forever since I step foot in here.  It's had to be at least 5 years and I've been really missing out. \\n\\nI've only been to one other Maggiano's and that one is located in Costa Mesa.  Maggiano's use to be the place where my favorite sister would take me for my birthday.  All I remember from Maggiano's is a lot of good food, huge portions, great service, and long waits even with a reservation.  \\n\\nThis Maggiano's is a lot similar to the Costa Mesa location.  This place was packed on Friday, great food, huge portions, and great service.  Only difference, which is a big one, there was zero wait.  I had their Parmesan Crusted Tilapia which was really good and the portions had to be triple of what you get compared to other restaurants. The $20 price tag is pretty good considering that I had over 10 oz of great tasting fish.  After my meal, I washed it down with 3 scoops for their Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  I offered to share, but everyone in our table had their own treat.  I didn't want to put my dessert to waste, so I killed it. \\n\\nThere's not too many Maggiano's around in any city.  I believe that this is the only one in Las Vegas.  I've never had a poor experience at Maggiano's and recommend if you're looking for fine Italian food with huge portions. \\n\\nPS:  Happy Birthday to Alicia R. (aka Terri R's twin, aka my 5K partner, aka my half marathon inspiration, aka Yes, and aka the former Finger Printing Lady).  Ha Ha...and more nicknames to come.\"b'I generally stay away from chain Italian food.  That being said, the food was not bad.  I had a capresse salad and the tomatoes could have been of slightly higher quality, but otherwise it was ok.  Certainly good enough for a safe tourist meal.'b\"Unpretentious, simply classy, affordable, good food. \\n\\nIf you want a little Italian while in Vegas but don't want all the hoopla this is your place. It's just like the great Italian spot you and your wife always go when you're craving a delicious chicken parm.\\n\\nRecommend.\"b\"Went here with my fiances family  and this place was amazing. They are Sicilian, so you can only imagine how important real Italian food is to them. We had a party of 12, and they treated us so nicely .\\nAnyway, the bathroom, has the BEST napkins I have ever dried my hands with! I know weird right, and apparently the men's has some pretty cool artwork above the urinals ( according to my fiance' ).\\n The food is amazing, hot, yummy. Some of the family  had the raviolis, lasagna, sausage appetizer, salads, the shrimp linguine; all was superb. Will be going again when in Vegas. Like prior comments it is a chain restaurant but run like an original!\\nThanks again for the lovely time!\"b\"Disclaimer: The only time I come here is for large birthday gatherings featuring: (1) the extremely young; and (2) the extremely old.  I've never independently chosen to eat here.\\n\\nI will say they have their sh$t together when it comes to large private gatherings.  They're always well staffed and organized, unlike other spots in town (*cough* PJ Clarkes *cough*).  The private rooms are also spacious and feature large windows -- you're not in some afterthought back room.\\n\\nFurther, the portions they provide for groups are enormous.  Even if there are 10 people at a table, it never runs out.  In fact, I usually get stuck with taking home leftovers.  Just what I always wanted, 4 lbs of artichoke dip......\\n\\nBUT, large portions aren't really a godsend if the food is just meh.  I've had the chicken &amp; eggplant parmesan, chicken piccata, penne with meat sauce, spagetti, caesar salad, stuffed mushrooms, calamari, profiteroles and...... none of it was memorable. \\n\\nOverall, they serve up very basic Italian food meant to please the masses......something easily achieved when the patrons are seven-years-old.....\"b'Had our wedding reception in the banquet hall, and it was an amazing space for our party. \\nGREAT Service\\nGREAT Food\\nGreat Drinks\\n\\nHighly Recommend.'b\"Yummy. Parmesan in crusted Talapia, momma's lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo, Cesar salad. 4.5 to 5 stars from all four of us. Fettuccine Alfredo is a huge portion.\"b\"Yes it's a chain, but the food is ALWAYS delicious. I love every shrimp dish they offer. The traditional Italian dishes are average, but my hubby loves them.\\n\\nService can be hit or miss. I just love the quality of food enough to forgive the occasional semi-bad waiter. (forgetful, have to ask multiple times for one thing) not a biggie.\"b'Great salads, food and service. There is not a bad seat in the house!!'b'Stopped by for happy hour - food was good (not remarkable, but yummy) however we were bowled over by the service.  Nicole waited on us and she was fantastic.  Really made our experience much nicer.'b\"Went with a  party of 10, went family style and two hours later still no entree.  Manager  understood the frustration, and said server was new.   Manager comped the bill, but didn't eat the food after two hours.  Waste of my time, and the restaurants supposed service.  Disappointing in both expectation and execution.\"b'Excellent food! Never had a bad meal or service here. I always get the take home classic pasta'b'i am a HUGE Maggianos fan at the Bellevue Washington location and was excited to see one of my favorite places on the strip. \\n\\nwe get to the restaurant at 5ish. with a party of 5. we are told about 1-1.5 hour wait. okay no problem after looking around and seeing countless open tables we ask why cant we sit at one of the patio tables, they responded with they are reserved but we don\\'t know when they are showing up.. \\n\\nwe finally take a seat after an hour wait for the table that was previously reserved but the group never showed up.. i was over it and excited and very hungry. \\n\\nwe ordered the first all you can eat family deal the food was amazing as always. \\n\\nthe service was slow, couldn\\'t answer simple menu questions.. do you meatballs have pork in them? (they don\\'t they are 100% beef)\\n\\nup to this point was was frustrated that everything seemed disorganized, sloppy and chaotic. it took 20 minutes to get bread on the table.\\n\\n------THE REASON FOR 1 STAR------\\n\\nwe were given a table outside on the patio and i was in the back corner of the table. as i was sitting at the table i scooted my chair over and back about 5\" it turns out there was a hole about 2-3\" deep that used to have a hand rail post sticking out of it but was removed to make more room.. i fell back in my chair and some how caught myself mid fall to avoid slamming my head into the cement wall behind me. i pop up and my dad said the dishwasher behind me had a look like i almost died and the server next to me said WHEN I WAS IN THE HOLE PULLING MY CHAIR BACK OUT. \"OH YEAH THERE IS A HOLE THERE\" WTF kind of observation is that. if you know about a preexisting hazard FIX IT!!!\\n\\nlong story short i pulled something my back and was instantly hurting. we contacted the manager who seemed on top of offered to take me to the hospital and call him if i had any problems.  i wasn\\'t about to have my last night in Vegas be ruined by that. for my Pain and all this we got 25% taken off the bill. and i left hurting and in pain.\\n\\n\\ni think this was a weak compensation for the pain the and hazard, have my mom or dad been sitting here they physically couldn\\'t have caught there balance as fast and would have been seriously hurt.'b'Fantastic food!  Loved that yelp helped us get a reservation at the time we wanted, walked right in and they were ready for us.  I had the Chicken Caprese, a special of the day, and it was amazing!! \\n\\nI second the hit-and-miss service--we had to ask for more water, and for our check.  They were busy, but found that annoying.  The mints are yummy--take a few! : )\\n\\nDespite service issues, I would definitely return and highly recommend!'b'Loved this place. Their food is amazing. We had the lobster carbonara, and one of their vegetarian ravioli dishes on their make a wish menu. Both were very tasty. Plates range from about 12-20 on average. The steak dishes are about double that. The chocolate cake is a must!'b\"Love the food here, it's extremely good, and I definitely recommend the daily specials. The outdoor patio is fantastic and as there's few places on the strip where you can eat outdoors, this is a great option for dining al fresco. Service is good, but it can take a while for your food to arrive.\\n\\nOne of the reasons I chose this place is that they will prepare your dish gluten free on request, if you ask. They also can substitute regular pasta with gluten free pasta.\\n\\nGood selection of wines by the glass, but it's rather expensive. $16 a glass is out of my league. However, they do have a happy hour from 3pm to 6pm Mon-Fri with a selection of beer, wines and cocktails for $6 or less.\\n\\nMore on gluten free in Las Vegas:\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/gluten.free.las.vegas/\"b'Good location, right at Fashion Show Mall. Fantastic Italian food, prices are not to bad either'b\"Good pasta. Good desserts. Good view.\\n\\nI've eaten at Maggiano's in Princeton, New Jersey and in Atlanta, Georgia. I really wanted to try Las Vegas' Maggiano's. It did not disappoint.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, which was delish. The warm, italian bread dipped in seasoned olive oil was finger-licking good; not that I licked my fingers... I had three delicious dishes for the mini dessert sampler: New York style cheesecake (yummy), apple crostada (yummy), and chocolate Zuccotto cake (yummy).\\n\\nThe price was pretty good. \\n\\nI dined alone as my friends were napping to recover from the evening's debaucheries. \\n\\nI will be back!\"b'The best Italian family style restaurant!'b'What a pathetic excuse for Italian food. In fact, what a terrible excuse for food in general. I ordered the \"Parmesan Crusted Tilapia\", which included mushy and obviously frozen fish and a bed of watery and bland spinach (3 leaves total) and orzo pasta. All off this was doused in an excess of capers and way too finely chopped cheap tomatoes. \\n\\nHowever, taste and presentation aside, and once all scraped off, the fish had a terribly sour after taste. Upon bringing it up to the waiter, it was blamed on the capers (great endorsement of the kitchen &amp; recipes). However after I left, my stomach was ill the entire night and into the next day. Sparing the intimate detail of my night spent with the toilet, the summary of this meal is that the fish was frozen and once defrosted it was obviously left out beyond expiration, and then cooked and presented with the effort of a 1st grader. \\n\\nAt this point I\\'d rather go vomit again than ever visit this establishment again. As an Italian and really as a human who eats food, I\\'m insulted at what this place is dishing out. \\n\\nSpend an extra $5 a dish and go to D.O.C.G. in The Cosmopolitan instead for real Italian food.'b'Great family priced meal for a large group. Came here to celebrate a birthday and we\\nEnjoyed. Only disappointing was the gnocchi. Waiter was excellent and the desserts were very enjoyable!'b\"Hadn't been here in a while and it was very yummy. Glad to see the recession didn't drag the quality down like at so many other chains.\"b\"Highly suggest Maggiano's inside the Fashion Show mall on the Las Vegas Strip. Great quality Italian! Yummy appetizers &amp; delicious meals like Momma would make!\\nRequest a table with a view &amp; you will love your visit even more! Friendly staff! Always go there when I'm in the mood for the best Italian food in Sin City! Great place to take a date or get family style dining with the friends or family!!\"b\"Maggianos has a great dinner time environment. We sat by the windows facing the strip and it was really beautiful to have the dark dining room looking out towards the bright LV strip. \\n\\nThe food was excellent and exactly what it should be at this price point. The food is not homemade but I think that's pretty apparent by the fact that it is in a Mall. It is however made to order and above the quality of most other chain restaurants.\\n\\nTiramisu here was the best I have ever had. I am still pretty new to tiramisu as I have only had it about five times but wow is it really good here. I will probably stop in just for the tiramisu every time I go shopping at fashion show. Make sure and try it.\"b'Great location in Vegas. Food is god, price is reasonable.Nothing too especial about it. Very small outdoor seating great indoors.'b'If you\\'re in the mood for overly-salted \"Italian\" food crafted specifically for the purpose of an American tourist palate and appetite, then please, come to Maggiano\\'s Little Italy. It\\'s helpfully located in the Fashion Show Mall as to beckon the tourists who cannot afford or do not know what *real* (and when I say real, I mean decent) Italian food is. \\n\\nI ventured here with a $25 gift card for lunch. My intent was to have the following: a tasty adult beverage, a soup, and a main dish. Being that one of my favorite Italian dishes (Linguine Clams) was on the menu I knew I would order it. \\n\\nFirst off I arrived a la solo, which I don\\'t think should be weird, especially for lunch these days. Of course, the hostess attempted to seat me at the bar, to which I declined politely and was lead to a table in the dining area. Impressions: at least it is well-lit during the daytime hours with plenty of windows for viewing the surrounding strip attractions. However, table cloths were rumpled, salt and pepper shakers had a waxy build-up on them. This comes from a restaurant wiping them down with nothing but a damp towel. I should know, I was a server in college. \\n\\nStarters - I ordered a Peach Bellini and my server brought bread. Sad, pitiful (but at least warm) bread. He did not pour my EVOO (which is on the table), nor did he offer me any balsamic. Yet, as I watched around me, servers plated EVOO and balsamic for THEIR tables. The Peach Bellini arrived in a martini glass. I was disappointed in that, and then even further disappointed that my peach Bellini was not garnished at all and it had no actual fruit in it. It was overly sweet, and not worth $9.  \\n\\nSoup ($3) - I ordered the Creamy Chicken Potato soup. It was salt. Salt. Salt. Salt. The vegetables were obviously of the frozen variety, and the presentation was horrific. The soup had spilled over the side of the cup and they hadn\\'t bothered to at least wipe it. \\n\\nLinguine Clams with Red Sauce ($15.95) - This dish should be called Linguine with clams because there was barely a trace of sauce in my bowl/plate. There were so many noodles I thought the waiter had served me a portion for three people. I get it, this is a \"family style\" place, but for lunch portions also? Also: SALT, SALT, SALT. The dishes here are obviously doctored to an \"Americanized\" \"Iodized\" diet. Hefty in portions and in salt. I could barely stomach my noddles and although the clams were decent, there was no \"seafood/brine\" taste to this dish that SHOULD be there. Comparing this Linguine Clams to others I have eaten (mainly at Chicago Joes downtown), well I just cannot even compare the two. \\n\\nThey do not make lunch portions. The lunch is just a shortened menu of their dinner. You get ginormous dinner portions and you pay the same amount of money. it\\'s honestly a tourist-trap rip-off.\\n\\nI am sure the better ratings of this place are coming from tourists. But being a local I can only offer this advice: there are much better Italian places in town. Find them and stay away from Maggianos.\\n\\nThank goodness I had a gift card.'b'What to say about this place. It is our fav spot for Italian food. \\n\\nAwesome Service \\nAwesome Long Island Drinks \\nAwesome Food \\n\\nI just hope they will not disappoint me ever because i just cant stop comparing others with them :)'b\"Love, love, love this location. We recently had our wedding reception here for 50 guests. I cannot describe how perfect everything went; from the ambiance, decor, to the food. All our guests loved every minute and will eat here every time they visit Vegas from now on. Thank you Maggiano's!\"b\"We had lunch there today. We had peach-pomegranite lemonade. It was so good, we got some to go. We shared the stuffed mushroom appetizer and shared the chicken Florentine. Both dishes were awesome! Our server was friendly and did not care in the least that we were not having alcohol for lunch or that we were sharing in order not to feel stuffed when we left. \\n\\nWe have eaten at Maggiano's in Atlanta a couple of times and the service and food was not this good.\\n\\nWe would definitely eat here again.\"b\"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant.  I think as far as value goes you get a great experience.  The views are great at this location.  Being right on the strip and having the whole wall on the strip side being windows it's a great view of the Wynn and Encore hotels.  I've had so many different meals here and never been disappointed.  The chicken parm. the rigatoni D(my favorite pasta dish here) and the Marsala are all fantastic.  For the price it is the best Italian restaurant I have ever been too and have been going to this Maggianos location for the last four years.  I've been to places in Vegas that are twice the price, half the portion, and 1/4 the food quality.   Don't miss this place if your in Vegas!\"b'Atmosphere 4/5\\nFood is 2/5\\nDisappointing !!'b'YUM!\\n\\nFirst of all, this place is really big, and the interior has a good blend of homey yet classy and kind of made me feel like a snobby foodie. :) The restaurant has window panes across two sides and allows for a nice view of Las Vegas blvd (but not like a straight down the strip kind of view). Our server was very gracious, and the bread was amazing!\\n\\nI ordered Chicken Florentine with Angel hair which absolutely blew my mind. The chicken was stuffed with spinach, parmesan cheese, and sun dried tomatoes and coated with bread crumbs. The flavors and textures were all perfect!\\n\\nThe best part was that the lunch price was not too price at all! Most of the pasta items were in the low-teens and the portions were enormous! \\n\\nI highly recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Vegas :)'b\"I eat here about twice a year and love the place. It's above average Italian for a fair price. I generally avoid carbs like the plague, but this place had bomb-diggity salads and wonderful protein options.\\n\\nI usually order the salmon, either grilled or on a Caesar salad and it's never bad. No, it isn't the best fish you'll ever have but for the price you shouldn't be expecting such things.\\n\\nI am all about reasonable expectations with food. I'd give the food a 3.5 and the service a 4 in the out-of-five-stars department.\"b\"Went here after shopping in the Fashion Show Mall as me and my friend both wanted Italian and I had come here before and knew that the food is pretty good. Last time I came here I had a Caesar salad which was good and is my favorite, but I decided to try the Maggiano's Salad this time. It was good, but it ended up being pretty filling, so I was almost too full to eat my spaghetti and meatballs, but luckily I took it home for later. I don't have anything negative to say about the food, and the wait time was 20 minutes which is average for dinner time in Vegas. Our server was decent...he could have refilled my water/soda more and he had to double check what we ordered even after asking us twice when he originally took our order. We sat by the window which was great for a view of the strip. I don't ever go out of my way to go to Maggiano's but the food is good and so is the staff.\"b'Slow Slow Slow service.   The food was good for me, my husbands filets were tough so he did not like it.  Kids liked their food but waiting 45 for the main course was a big turn off for us.'b'Atmosphere and service were great; however the food was just average. \\n\\nLobster carbonara tasted like what you would expect from the Olive Garden.\\nItalian sausage flat bread was ok as well.\\n\\nThere are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that I would try again.'b\"This weekend I had a beautiful private dining experience at Maggiano's at Fashion Show.  My friends hosted my baby shower in a private room (with a great view and patio included!) for 30 people, passed appetizers, food table, dessert table and open bar.  It turned out beautifully and I could not be happier!  We worked with Sabrina, banquet manager, who was superb.  She recommended a menu (which was delicious and everyone loved the food!) for my mixed group (vegetarians, kids and adults), and helped us orchestra a budget that worked for the hosts.  I cannot tell you how grateful I am to have someone so lovely and gracious be a part of my special afternoon with my dear friends and family.\\nI would do this again the exact same way and I'm looking for reasons to book another get-together in the same spot.\"b\"3 1/2 - 4 ****\\nLocated in the Fashion Show Mall, tons of parking and glass windows to enjoy the scenery.  \\nReservations highly recommended as it can get very busy. \\n\\nI've eaten here several times and for some reason I keep coming back.  It must be the large portions and great service. \\n\\nFood: \\nSpinach Salad- Tender leaf spinach tossed with diced red peppers, roasted red onions and Gorgonzola cheese, yummy applewood smoked bacon, toasted pine nuts and apple cider vinaigrette. \\nTomato Caprese-Sliced tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, drizzled with a balsamic glaze and Crispy Calamari. \\n\\nDinner: \\nLobster Carbonara- It  was dry so I would never order it again. \\nMom's Lasagna with Meat Sauce\\nBeef Tenderloin Medallions\\n\\nIt' really not a bad place despite of what others has said.   To me it's reasonably priced, service was great and I love the complimentary bread.\"b\"My brother and I went there when we were in Las Vegas and the food was very delicious. The belinis were out of this world.\\n\\nThe manager came to check up on us at the table to see if we were being taken care of. This was, of course, during a commercial. He was watching the game on the TV screens and couldn't be bothered during the game and kindly waited for a commercial.\\n\\nAfter lunch, the manager and the waitstaff were congregated in the front of the reception area as we were about to leave and my brother and I both felt we were breaking up coffee talk.\\n\\nOther than that, the experience was great as well as the food.\"b'Called to make reservations for a party of 7, Hostess on the phone said they were booked and pretty busy however we can walk in and wait... \\n\\nOn the way down I was able to make Reservation via Internet, however we still thought the Restaurant would have at least an hour wait for a \"BUSY\" Saturday night as the Hostess stated.... come to our surprise Restaurant was far from Busy, and we were sat almost instantly. \\n\\nVery pleased with the Food, Great sized Portions, Complimentary bread oil and vinegar, however being lied too over the phone was rude, and almost made us change our dinner plans for the evening....'b\"I went their for my husbands birthday the food was really good ... Omg the four cheese ravioli are the best if you're planning to go you have to try them :)\"b\"I know this is not an authentic Italian place, but some of their dishes are just the BOMB. Like the Rigatoni D - omg and their Penne with meat sauce - I don't know... I just love love love it. It so hits the spot. \\n\\nI make crazy good pasta sauces all the time so I am a skeptic but sometimes even the commercialized stuff can be tasty.\"b'Another chain restaurant where we decided to check out the Vegas branch. This was a very large location, with a fun view of the strip. Service was attentive and friendly, and our food was fine- definitely edible, but nothing special. My peach bellini was my favorite part.'b'I went here for my 21st birthday dinner. Thankfully it was in walking distance from my hotel. The food was amazing, everyone in my party (party of 11) loved what they got and devoured it. I ordered the Linguine de Mare and it was amazing. I also heard great things about the spaghetti, my friend said it reminded her of the way her grandma would make it. The service was good, and I enjoyed being serenaded for my birthday by the cutest old man playing the guitar. Overall very pleased with my experience.'b\"Nice place for a lunch if you're in Fashion Show and don't want standard food-court food.\"b\"This was a great place to eat on the strip.  We didn't have reservations, but we took seats in the bar area. Other reviews suggested reservations, so if you have a large group or need to make a show, make reservations.  I had the tomato basil soup and chopped salad. Both were wonderful.  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs. My children had the cheese ravioli's and the penne pasta. They also offer family style meals if you prefer that.  The waitress was very friendly and service was great.  I would recommend this to anyone going to Vegas. so much of the food we ate was overpriced and mediocre. This was reasonably priced and delicious.\"b'We met up with a group of friends at Maggiano\\'s on a Friday evening for one of their birthdays. Due to the size of our party, we ordered family style. This works out better for appetites such as mine, as I can usually help devour whatever is left over.\\n\\nWe went with the larger set-up of family style meals, which looked to be a good deal. As we awaited our appetizers and salads, an older gentleman stopped by the table with his acoustic guitar to sing some songs, he played three (including happy birthday) and wished our friend another happy birthday before he went to another table. And proceeded to play the same three songs (but with more gusto for them); and to the next table, you guessed it... same three songs. \\n\\nThe appetizers came out, we opted for the fried mozzarella and zucchini. The mozz was great! Wish there was a little more sauce on the plates or some ranch. The fried zucchini came with what looked like ranch, so it all worked out. Nope, that is a lemon sauce that masquerades as ranch. When asked for a side of ranch, we were rebuffed with a, \"We don\\'t carry ranch here.\" OK then.\\n\\nOur main courses began to roll out, this time our table became filled with lasagna, ravioli, alfredo and a go-to Italian dish: chicken parmagiana.\\n\\nWhere to begin? The lasagna had a very pre-made/frozen taste to it, however, Stouffer\\'s tastes more authentic than Maggiano\\'s. Their iteration of chicken parm was ghastly. It seemed like it was cooked in a microwave with its rubbery, tough, dry and flavorless texture.\\n\\nI did not partake in the ravioli or alfredo until the next day, which is where I messed up. Those two dishes were the best of the four we chose.\\n\\nDesserts came out and they looked amazing. I, however, don\\'t eat dessert, so I can only go off of the very little that was left to ascertain that it was pretty good.\\n\\nOnto day 2... I awoke Saturday morning with some serious pain. A mixture of \"I ate too much and now I am starving\" and \"RUN\". After a few trips to eliminate the intestinal pain, I was feeling good again.\\n\\nThat evening, my wife re-heated the leftovers we were given according to the instructions on the to-go containers. Once more into the breach we went, devouring what was left. The ravioli and alfredo I skipped the night before were really tasty and I wished I had tried them the first night.\\n\\nSunday morning was a repeat of Saturday morning. Needless to say, I shan\\'t be patronizing Maggiano\\'s again. The service was pretty good, the ambiance was nice. As is usually an issue for restaurants, it was the food that will keep me from going back.'b'We had our wedding reception at Maggianos on 8.10.13 after our wedding ceremony at Wynn Las Vegas.  It was 5+ STARS!  They took excellent care of us and we planned everything from out of town (we live in LA).  The reception could not have been more perfect and everyone at Maggianos made it so easy for us!  Our banquet captain Jessie Mzoughi was incredible!  I highly recommend them for your reception or any event!'b\"Spur of the moment decision to eat at maggiano's food was good not great and service lacked in every way horrible is being nice.  They had an excuse for everything. Do not recommend. Wait staff was not professional.\"b'Great customer service from our waiter Pete. He was awesome.  Very friendly and attentive.  Portions are so big you can share. Great authentic Italian food.'b'I tried to go here last night; party of five.  The hostess told us that it would be an hour and 45 minutes before we could be seated, even though there were only a couple of people waiting and there were a few tables inside and all but two tables outside were being used.\\n\\nNo problem, we went downstairs to RA and had a great meal.'b\"For over six years now, whenever my wife and I go to Vegas, this place has been a favorite. I love the gnocchi and Italian sausage, but haven't had anything I didn't like. \\n\\nPicture this: last night; Monday night; in Vegas again on business; four of us looking for a good meal; walk up to the counter and they are telling everyone it's an hour and a half wait; good thing I had a reservation. We were seated in minutes, 8:06 to be exact. Not bad for an 8:00 reservation. \\n\\nIt was all good, as always. The service and especially the food!\"b\"Went here today (22nd Aug) whilst in Vegas, we haven't left Vegas yet and I felt I needed to write a review.\\n\\nEverything from start to finish was horrible. I ordered the chicken Parmesan. The chicken was tough, over cooked and tasteless. It came with a side of spaghetti marinara. The spaghetti was over cooked, mushy and the whole thing was very plain.\\nNeedless to say I didn't even eat half of my meal.\\n\\nMy friend ordered some sort of pasta and seafood dish (I cannot remember the name) and despite that naturally having slightly more flavour due to it being seafood, the pasta was mushy also and tasteless. \\n\\nI asked for bottled water, they brought me tap water which I thought ok cool nevermind... I don't know what they did to the tap water there but (maybe it was the ice cubes they used?) but there was a hideous aftertaste of antiseptic! \\n\\nOur server never checked on us once, because if so I would have told her I disliked my meal and also ordered another drink. We had to ask her for the cheque three times and after we finished eating our meal and were given our cheque, it was 25 minutes before our plates were cleared.\\n\\nNeedless to say I will not be returning.\"b'Our waiter, Antonio, was AH-MAZE-ING!!! He took the best care of us. The most incredible service. Love him!!!!'b'Loved this place! First time there was a date night with husband and since we have a new baby it doesnt happen very often. Food was amazing, service was fast and the manager gave us a free dessert in celebration of the special night. Will be going back for sure.'b\"I've been to Maggiano's a number of times, and I have not been disappointed yet.  The calamari is delicious, as are most of the pastas on the menu.  My biggest complaint is the price.  Even though the food is good, I really don't feel that it justifies the high price tag.  There are a number of basic pastas that you can get for less than $15, but these are bare bones dishes.  While still good, you're going to have to spend $20-$30 per dish if you really want to experience what they really have to offer that makes them great.  The atmosphere at Maggiano's differs between restaurants.  The Maggiano's in Denver has a much more classy, and quiet environment with great ambiance.  The Vegas location is much more noisy, usually overcrowded and the service much more casual.  Here's a few tips; make a reservation online, and in the comment box request a booth.\"b\"Very good food, excellent service.  Loved that they have gluten free pasta choices.  Our whole party was  happy with their entrees.  The lobster carbonara was especially tasty.  Lost one star for wine list.  Not as robust as we'd hoped.\"b'Made a reservation here and was seated with no problem; but then again there was no wait. Service was pretty good, my girlfriend and I came as a short last dinner before heading back to reality. I would give our server a solid B+/A- considering menu explanation, time it took to get his attention, he remembered my to-go order, and we spent less than an hour there from being sat to exiting.\\n\\nWe had:\\n-Side spinach salad with gorgonzola cheese: pretty yummy, I am a fan of gorgonzola but I think huge chunks were a little much, even for me. Dressing was a little heavy.\\n-Linguine &amp; Clam: good broth in the pasta, healthy amount of clams\\n-Peppercorn steak w/ the Maggiano\\'s sauce which was carmelized onion and such: so yummy; a bit salty so you have to eat it with the mashed potatoes but the potatoes had melted cheese and it was so so good.\\n\\nDo want to mention that this restaurant did not have the classic \"buy one take one home\" menu options that are available at a lot of other chains, though.'b\"I love Maggianos. I can't get enough of the Famous Rigatoni D. &amp; they have the best calamari. I am also in love with the marinara sauce they use for the spaghetti as well as the chicken parmesan. Friendly staff &amp; usually not very crowded when I come here. &amp; I feel like I'm in the 1940s with the music they play. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat.\"b'A tourist trap where location may be the only thing to recommend it.   Food at a level lower than a chain Italian and service was completely absent minded. At least they comped a drink and a meal from our party of four.  Avoid as there are so many good options why waste your limited dining experience on a restaurant that has such indifferent food and service?'b'We had our wedding reception here on August 3rd...IT WAS PERFECT!! The food was amazing, and there was LOTS of it! Our guests were thrilled. We had 120 guests, so we took up all of the banquet space. The dance floor was packed the entire time thanks to the DJ they recommended to us. We also used their vendors for cake and photo booth. \\n\\nSabrina was very accommodating, and quick to respond to my questions via email or phone. \\n\\nI cannot recommend this place enough as a wedding reception venue. It looks good without any decor, even! Especially for Wynn brides - it is very convenient.'b'Great food! Typical Italina food (or Americanized Italian food rather).'b'When I was visiting Las Vegas my sister said this place was good so we went to eat here for lunch and happy hour. I was impressed. The $4 margherita flat bread from the happy hour menu was more than a foot long and so delicious! The house bread was warm and soft. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and it was so good. The eggplant was juicy and not dry and the spaghetti was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not too thick which I like. The staff was nice and friendly and very attentive.'b'Love , love , lovvveee the foood . I would eat there everyday if I could ! Everything is made from scratch no presevatives , no frozen food. Tastes awesome :) I had the beef tenderloin with a side of mash potatoes and Asparagus, and the spinach artichoke appetizer to start with. Couldnt finish off with desert this time \" way too full \" but Ive had the Tiramisu in the past and its devine !'b'Waiter suggested special - chicken lasagna- Alfredo sauce almost non existent but dish still good. Ordered the second special ravioli with lemon \"cream\" sauce - it arrived and the sauce was like warm milk - very watered down - sent it back and split the lasagne.'b\"Viva' Las Vegas, was my destination this weekend. And decided to take the girlfriend and parents to dinner here. I always enjoy this place. Did the family style, and if you never done family style food, well get on it. Its fun. \\n\\nGreat food, from appetizers to entree's and also the desserts.. Everyone agreed the Mom's Lasagna was amazing, the Gnocchi &amp; Italian Sausage was incredible , the  Crab &amp; Shrimp Cannelloni was to die for, and Linguine &amp; Clams,\\nRed or White Clam Sauce was out of this site. \\n\\nSo heads up if you do go, maybe call ahead of time, its a super busy place. We totally lucked out and sat outside since it was nice evening. But inside is very nice. Do you need to dress up? I would say at least wear a collar shirt guys.. \\n\\nOur waitress for the evening was very helpful and very fun. The only problem it took a while for us to get our appetizers, which she apoligized all night long. We didn't mind, we had our drinks in hand and having a good time. But other then that another great experience in the book.. Hope you guys enjoy. Because the food is amazing..\"b'Terrible hostesses. I walked in at 5:30 abd asked how long the wait for 3 people was. I was told no wait. I said my people will be here at six can I put my name in a list, knowing it would get busy.  St sux I was told the wait was an hour.  Take your seats immediately even if your party is not there yet.   Customer service is non existent they count on the one shot tourist trade..\\n\\nAfter some discussion the manager Mike M. Made things right..  hopefully his staff will improve under his tutelage.'b'Amazing Italian in vegas. Especially for a chain.\\nThe lobster ravioli never disappoints.\\nThe drinks are allways off the chain.\\nThe only thing that stinks is the wait.  Super location, decent prices if youre looking to dine on strip outside a casino.  Love thi splace.'b'Vorneweg - das Ambiente ist klasse, der Service sehr gut, und das Essen ist auch hervorragend.\\nMan kann hier in einer gem\\xc3\\xbctlichen Atmosph\\xc3\\xa4re einen sch\\xc3\\xb6nen Abend verbringen. Der Service ist hilfsbereit, immer zu Stelle und entspricht allen positiven Vorurteilen.\\nZum Essen aber einen Hinweis: Es schmeckt ausgezeichnet aber es macht sehr satt, die Gr\\xc3\\xb6\\xc3\\x9fe der Portionen ist landestypisch. Die Menge des K\\xc3\\xa4ses auf den Gerichten auch und ebenso die Menge der Schokolade auf dem Tiramisu. Vielleicht ein wenig \\xc3\\xbcberladen f\\xc3\\xbcr europ\\xc3\\xa4ischen Geschmack - aber keinesfalls schlecht. Mit landestypisch ist hier \\xc3\\xbcbrigens nicht typisch italienisch gemeint...'b\"Aside from the box pasta they use I enjoyed my time here.  We made a reservation via Yelp and was immediately seated upon arrival :-) The food was so-so.  The lasagna was dry and the linguine with clams sauce did not stick to the pasta.  I'm from Chicago and this maggiano's was not great.\"b'My husband and I came here for my 25th birthday dinner and let me just tell you, our waiter Anthony made our experience absolutely exceptional. He made conversation like we had known each other for years! We wanted to hug him on our way out the door! My husband and I have traveled a lot and it was the best service we have had ANYWHERE. The food was delectable. I had the lobster carbonara and my husband had the seafood pasta. His dish was piled high with seafood. Usually you only get a couple of each type of seafood but he literally had a plate full. I got a free birthday tiramisu and Anthony also brought me cute little lemon cookies with candles on them! An all around a Wonderful experience!'b'Heard great things about this place but wasn\\'t impressed. It took over an hour to get our dinner. Had simple fettuccini Alfredo w chicken. It had decent taste but the sauce had the consistency of soup. It was so runny I could not eat it w my fork. The only place I saw the chicken was on my bill! On a good note the bread was good! \\nSadly this will make my list of the \"one and done\".'b\"Don't need to try\\nFood is ok not too special\\nA little pricey for its value\"b'Park in valet behind it take elevator straight up to the restaurant. BEST fried zucchini and lemon aioli anywhere ( this is truly why I come here !!) .'b\"We were there over an hour and a half just to eat lunch.  Waitress was so slow took 20-30 between each time we seen her.  People next to us called over a manager because it took 25 minutes to just get a to go box.  I think it was more of Colette attitude that caused most of the anxiety with everyone.  She just doesn't know how to multi task.  We had other servers and manager to fill up our drinks and even to get us a bill.  However the food is always amazing.  They just need to work on training :(\"b\"I visit Las Vegas three times or more per year, and ever time we have to stop and eat at Maggiano's. It reminds me of some of the old Italian Restaurants back East. It's Italian comfort food and the service is excellent. Last year my wife and I celebrated our 30th Wedding Anniversary and we booked our dinner at Maggiano's. The waiter was not only attentive, but engaging. He interacted so well with everybody from my 90year old mother to my 4 year old grandchildren. The food was great.\"b'Again, not impressed, although my dinner experience was a thousand times better than my solo lunch experience. I am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat. I should have known, but kept my hopes up none the less. My husband and I were invited to a date night dinner here, so we went along for the ride.\\n\\nFirst off, service was a tad better this time around. Our waiter was a bit of an odd-ball though. I have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the Happy Hour price. He was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant\\'s extensive menu. Happily telling us all kinds of things, including his opinion of the Marsala sauce that is very unlike his Italian grandmothers.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n\\nCalamari Fritte, served with marinara. It was fried Calamari. Luckily though it was not soggy or gross. It was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app. \\n\\nSpinach &amp; Artichoke Al Forno - I am a fan of artichokes in apps. My favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is. However, I was not impressed with this dip. It is baked in an Asiago and Alfedo-like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip I have had.\\n\\nCrab &amp; Shrimp Cannelloni ($18.50) - Ugh! What a waste of money. This dish came out in a POOL of cheese sauce. Literally, the entire plate was cheese sauce. The menu description says this, \"Asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs\". No. There were no breadcrumbs. My plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce, with three lone Cannellonis that had, perhaps, 4-5 pieces of shrimp. The peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit. The cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop, just smooshy and gross. I was incredibly disappointed in this dish.\\n\\nI wish I had gotten the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce, which is what my husband got, and he cleaned his plate!\\n\\nCreme Brulee ($7.95) - A huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough. Okay, I\\'m just kidding it wasn\\'t served in a trough, but it might as well have been. The dessert portions are large, so ya know, share. My husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and I was left to eat the rest of it.\\n\\nAgain, as an overall opinion - it\\'s over-priced, over-salted, overly-hyped Italian food on The Strip. It\\'s a chain Italian restaurant I will continue to avoid.'b\"Long wait on a Veteran's day weekend. Almost 2 hours wait!!! =( but the steak was good.. and the appetizers. Mozerella Marinara and the Center Cut Filet Mignon..yum\"b'Sara our server was FANTASTIC.  We had a large group of 16 people for our wedding dinner.  I had made reservations 2 weeks in advance. They called the day prior to the reservation to confirm and then they called the morning of the reservation date to get my order for the family style dinner. I selected from the Chefs selection menu. Lobster baked tilapia, chicken parmesan, mushroom il fornaio and beef tenderloin medallions. For appetizers we selected the calamari, caprese and bruschetta.  For dessert we selected creme br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e and tiramisu. Absolutely everyone enjoyed everything they ate! The meat entrees were all tender and juicy. Nothing was over cooked or under cooked. The food was served timely- longest wait was 5 mins between appetizers and entrees.  The portions and amount of food can be described as ABUNDANT. The customer service was perfect. They allowed us to bring our wedding cake earlier in day and served it at the end of the wedding feast! I highly recommend them for special events!'b'I ordered take out.  Four cheese ravioli with pesto Alfredo.  I drove home and to my dismay my pasta was covered in marinara. I called and the manager answered.  He was very kind and said he would start the correct order right away.  He explained the dish is garnished in marinara.  However I did not read that in the description and dislike tomato sauce.  As soon as I returned to the restaurant they replaced the pasta. I was frustrated I had to drive all the way back, but they gave really great service.'b\"My what a difference a year makes...both in how I write Yelp reviews and in my Maggiano's experience. I was back at Maggiano's for a private event and this time it was much better. Yes, they serve the dishes family style. Yes, you pay a slightly inflated price I attribute to the unofficial Strip surcharge. You get past all that and you'll find some good food here. \\n\\nOn this occasion there was one item that had me going back for more: Crispy Zucchini Fritte. The zucchini is a diet killer. Calorie counting? Yeah, forget about that. Just make sure you get yours before the rest of the table does. \\n\\nThe rest of the items I tried today were good, but there was nothing that warranted asking for a box to take it with me. The Fettuccine Alfredo was respectable, not the best I've ever had but it certainly was filling and I sneaked in a second small helping of it. The Chicken Piccata was actually disappointing. I masked my disappointment by having more Caesar salad and where did that Zucchini go again? \\n\\nOne note to the staff...the Lemon Cookies were too cold. But the Apple Crostada made me forget all about the cookies...\\n\\nAs this was a business function, the Maggiano's staff took great care of my needs and of everyone that I work with. All things considered 4 Stars seems appropriate. \\n\\nAlmost forgot to mention one more thing. The Valet seems super slow here. If you're in a hurry to get somewhere else plan accordingly.\"b\"Came here on a Wednesday night at ~7:45pm with a party of 8... the hostess estimated a wait time of about an hour and 45mins; however, we got lucky and got seated in 20mins because a larger party had just left.\\n\\nEverything seemed to have gotten off to a good start. Once we were seated our server was super knowledgeable of the menu, which was great. Also he tailored the service to our party which had 3 kids, this was also great.\\n\\nHowever there were certainly some service failures... we sipped on water for ~25 minutes (yes I timed it) before our actual drinks came in and he would literally ramble off every single ingredient in the specialty menu before letting us order, it was like he was reading a disclaimer off of one of those TV commercials.\\n\\nI finally ended up ordering the Chicken Marsala and the Fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce on the chicken marsala  was creamy but watery and the mushrooms were soggy and looked like they had been left in the salamander for too long. \\n\\nThe Fettuccini was also a little tough and the Alfredo sauce had texture like mayo, not as creamy/runny as it should have been. It was chunkier than the marsala!\\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere felt moderately upscale and the servers knowledge accompanied by the; however, for the price we paid the service and food quality did not meet my expectations. I would rate the atmosphere 4/5, the service 3/5, and the food quality 2/5\\n\\nTip: View is great, atmosphere is moderately upscale, and the service is adequate. If you're looking to impress a date this is a great spot. However if you're just looking for some great Italian food with your family or a large party this is not a good spot for the money.\\n\\nTip: Menu is small and it is periodically updated, something to keep in mind just in case you had a favorite.\"b'My wife and I love this place. This is my favorite Italian place in vegas. The prices are good. The food is great. We have been here twice. Both times service was great. Love the food. If you want real food. real serving sizes, and decent prices, come here for your Italian food needs.'b'Went here and it is nice to be able to park and go up the elevator right into the restaurant.   Food was extremely good and the service was excellent.  The prices were very affordable as well.  Will definitely go back soon.'b\"2 hour wait! OMG -_- The food is good, but not 2 hour good.\\n\\nPeople, without reservations that came after us, were called before we were. We had a table of 6. We were so hungry by the time they called us that we ordered a bunch of appetizers- mussels, mozzarella sticks, and calamari. The complimentary bread was okay... not my favorite type of bread. \\n\\nI thought I ordered pasta because I saw pictures on Yelp... but it wasn't on their menu. The shrimp &amp; crab pasta on Yelp pictures are different than the menu's shrimp &amp; crab cannelloni. It was actually good though- 3 crepes filled with cheese, crab, and shrimp. Everyone else ordered pasta carbonara and steak. Everyone liked their food so that was good. It was a great experience but the wait is killer.\"b\"This place is crazy busy, but the Crispy Zucchini app was stellar and worth the wait. Our entree was just ok, the linguine di mare, probably wouldn't order it again. Our server really was phenomenal, and took great care of us.\"b'MAGGIANO\\'S LITTLE ITALY ... EPIC FAIL LAST NIGHT!\\n\\n\\nOK, so last night (10/2/13) we returned to Maggiano\\'s Little Italy restaurant in the Fashion Show Center, on the Vegas strip, expecting our usual fine dining experience.  But things went badly awry.  \\n\\nHere\\'s how our evening went:\\n* 5:00 -  check in and immediately get seated in a nice booth with a view of the Strip.  So far, so good.\\n* 5:15 -  finally get some water.  Hmmm.\\n* 5:25 -  finally asked what we wanted to drink.  As we already had plenty of time to ponder, we immediately gave our entire order.\\n* 5:40 -  bread and olive oil arrive.\\n* 5:55 -  bruschetta and salad finally arrive.  Really, 30 minutes for bruschetta and a house salad?\\n* 6:25 -  entr\\xc3\\xa9es finally arrive.  No special requests, mind you, just the house special.  WTH!\\n* 6:35 -  we ask for our bill and some take-home containers, so we can head out to our show.\\n* 6:50 -  we sign our bill and head out, thank heavens.\\n\\nHow about the food?  Salad dressing contained some new, hotter peppers than previously.  Wife took a few bites and quit.  Bruschetta was good.\\n\\nEntr\\xc3\\xa9es were very disappointing.  We had our usual Rigatoni \"D\", a house specialty, which is usually excellent.  Not so, last night.  The sauce was so watered down that it wouldn\\'t adhere to any of the rigatoni, mushrooms or chicken.  We had to dunk our bread into it to get any, or it just dripped off like water.  \\n\\nMy wife plans to \"doctor\" the sauce a bit to make it workable, and we\\'ll try the leftovers tonight.  Hope she can fix it.\\n\\nLast night Maggiano\\'s failed badly.  Never had that happen at Gaetano\\'s ... ever.  Guess where we\\'re going from now on.\\n\\nDean Herrington'b\"My husband and I stopped in for an early weekend lunch recently. We had the entire place to ourselves for a bit around 11:30. It's attached to the Fashion Show Mall, and it seemed like most were just grabbing a quick bite in the food court instead. \\n\\nI liked the fact that our server asked if we preferred butter or olive oil and parmesan to go along with our bread. Gimme' the oil and parm, please! A pet peeve of mine is that a few select Italian restaurants in St. Louis want to up-charge for this... yes, seriously. Anywho, we carbed out on the stuff. :)\\n\\nI ordered the chicken and spinach cannelloni, while my husband went with the chicken parmesan. Both lunch portions were friggin' HUGE! My husband actually had two full breasts of chicken on his plate served with a large side of pasta. Four noodles came in my order, and had big chunks of chicken in every bite. We made a good dent in the dishes, but still had plenty left over. We both agreed that it was good, but it didn't compare to the good ole' authentic Italian we both love so much.\"b\"I love the food here but this experience wasn't as great as it was in the past. I made a reservation and when we arrived we were told that there weren't any tables available. It wasn't even that busy! But we waited patiently for about 20 minutes so that wasn't horrible. And then our cocktails took at least 20 minutes to arrive at the table. Once we ordered, my soup came out eventually. I had two bites and then the entrees came out. By the time I finished my soup, the cheese on my pasta was no longer hot. Gross. Overall it wasn't a terrible experience, but the previous times were much better. I guess that's why I gave the 3 stars. It wasn't terrible... Just made my eye twitch\"b'Always a good lunch spot! Food and service are consistently good!'b\"Wow!  Wow!  Wow!\\nGreat Food!  Great Service!  Great Ambiance!\\nWe were looking for a place to take our father for his 78th birthday dinner.  He loves Italian.  Though Maggiano's is a chain, this location beats all of the other locations we have visited.  The waiter (Nester) was terrific.  We decided to do the Classic Family Style.  There was almost too much food for all of us.  Each course and entree was delicious.  Calamari was perfect.  Steamed mussels were awesome.  Caesar Salad was bountiful and a good palate cleanser before the entrees.  Peppercorn Beef, Salmon, Chicken Piccata, and Linguine with red clam sauce were all perfect together.  But remember you have two desserts coming so make some room.  On this particular evening they had a gentlemen playing the violin.  He came over and serenaded our father with Happy Birthday.  Bottom line Father loved it all. Thanks Maggiano's!\"b'Great atmosphere, make sure to park Valet on the northeast corner of the mall and take elevator. We made reservations and was seated promptly. Our server, Seidi was unbelievable and offered great suggestions. She made our party feel very welcomed. Food was great!\\n\\nRecommendations:\\nApp- zucchini sticks\\nMeal- Chicken Parm\\nDes- tiramisu'b'Food was very good! I had chicken piccata and hubby had stuffed shells from their holiday menu. The stuffed shells were to die for! Had a frozen Bellini which I would recommend! Will go back next time we visit Vegas!'b\"Be careful where you get sat. Hostess sent us to a long rectangular bar table right behind the hostess stand, yet there is no waiter service there, as we found out from the three other couples that were in the same predicament.  After some discussion with manager, we got our meal comped (all we wanted was pasta to go for the little guy).  I've been before and had a good visit, but this time was no bueno.  Kudos to manager for recognizing the situation, we were about to walk out.\"b\"I have being here a couple of times , and all experience so we're excellent. .food is delicious , atmosphere is great. .love the complimentary bread..fettuccine to die for..definitely my place to eat when I shop at fashion show\"b\"Wait was terrible. It was Friday night after 10 pm and the place was busy. We were a party of four.  Our flatbread was cold and placed on a menu on the table, dishes not cleared, no butter or oil offered. Brought entree before salad. When we asked for more bread, he brought 2 pcs for four people  Not sure if he was mad we didn't order drinks or wine?\"b\"Ma-Ma-Ma-Maggiano's I sure love you!  Why? Because you make my tummy happy!\\n\\nI have been going to Maggiano's on and off since the Las Vegas location opened.  I had never heard of the chain before because I am not really an Italian food fan and tend not to notice those restaurants around town.  I went here for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner a while back and have been hooked ever since!  \\n\\nBefore Maggiano's, I was a pasta hater.  I know, I know, I am a weirdo, but I just wasn't into any pasta.  I would only eat it if I had to, but it was never a first, second, or third choice for me.  That was until I had the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti.  This is in my Top 10 dishes ever.  That very night after eating this dish, I kid you not, I had a dream about it.  Yes, when I have a great meal, I will dream about it.  I still get this dish 99% of the time.  Every time I get it, it makes my whole day.  If I could get away with it in public, I would totally lick the plate to get all of the sauce off because I don't want to waste one drop of that awesome Alfredo goodness.  When I do try a different dish, I often feel like I am having a food affair and cheating on my precious manicotti Yes, I love it that much.\\n\\nI have tried a few other dishes (while having a food affair) and they have all been good.  I really have enjoyed the Chicken Saltimbocca, Eggplant Parm, Lasagna, and the Beef Tenderloin Medallions.  I don't think I have ever heard anyone I was with not like one of their dishes.  Yummy yum.\\n\\nThe kid's menu is also fantastic as well.  The food is awesome adult quality except it is just a little more friendly to a kid palates.  They have all sorts of pasta options, chicken fingers, and pizza.  The kid's chicken fingers are ridiculously tasty because yes, I steal my kid's food on occasion.  Every kid's meal is $5.95 for a big entree, dessert, and a drink.  This is a better deal than a lot of restaurants that serve kid's mediocre food.  I love a good deal!\\n\\nOne good tip I have for you is to make a reservation ahead of time.  This particular location always seems to be busy, no matter what time of day.  They are on OpenTable.com, so making a reservation is super easy 24/7.  \\n\\nIf you have never been to a Maggiano's, you should give it a try.  And of course my recommendation would be the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti!\"b'The service here is awful. It took us an hour to be sat. We never it bread, it felt like a very uncaring environment. The food might be good but I am not sure because it is taking so long to get served that I might die of starvation first. I have been waiting so long that I have time to write all this. Also stingy with the bread and balsamic.'b\"We visit Las Vegas between 2-5 times a year and have never dined at Maggiano's.  \\n\\nGreat place to relax, have a delicious bite and not spend a whole bunch of money.\\n\\nI had the Chicken Romano and my boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatball.  I wanted to trade dishes with him.  That is the way I enjoy my spaghetti!!  Perfect!!!\\n\\nVanessa was our server and she was efficient and friendly.\\n\\nOnly downfall about the visit was the parking lot.  It was full and confusing.  Better if you walk there.\\n\\nWe will visit Maggiano's again, for sure!!\"b'I was instantly alarmed when we were seated and I saw food stuck on the empty wine glass in front of me. I could hardly place a drink order with the server because I was so fixated on this overlooked problem. Only compounding the unease, we were placed on the edge of the aisle, the front legs of my chair were on a carpeted area and the back in the aisle ... so I always felt like I was about to fall off my chair. (And this was before the wine!) \\n\\nOur server was curt and lacked warmth. I think this may have been the result of me being sucked into the tractor beam of the dirty wine glass when I was ordering. We had to ask twice for butter (over EVOO). However, we were truly glad this restaurant was open so late! (Most every sit-down establishment was was closed except Buca and Maggiano\\'s). \\n\\nWhile it is chain food and has that \"chain\" quality (frozen), it is still filling and occasionally tasty. If you are a vegetarian, be careful! Many of the appetizers (like the stuffed mushrooms) and entrees use chicken-stock for flavor (which is not posted on the menu). We discovered this \"the hard way.\" Ask your server for guidance.\\n\\nMaggiano\\'s receives high-marks from us for being open late in this city that seems to close-down everything but the casinos after 10:30. Nonetheless, the walk to the deserted Fashion Mall (at this hour) is truly harrowing (we saw NO security in this area whatsoever) so go in a large, alert group. Seriously.'b\"Friends made reservations here for dinner and I expected the usual high Las Vegas prices and brusque service. I was pleasantly surprised in that the service was excellent and the food was super-delicious. \\n\\nI tried one of the pasta specialties with chicken and shrimp and it was excellent for only $18.50. Everyone else commented on how good their food was. \\n\\nI highly recommend Maggiano's for a fantastic Italian dinner in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. I'm looking forward to my next dinner there!\"b\"Big, crowded, popular eatery.  Food is good, not great but I'm a food snob.  Girls at reception desk were too busy flirting with guy to greet guests, had to wait several minutes till they finally noticed I was standing there.  Ate at the bar, Jeremy the bartender was fantastic with great service and recommendations.\"b'I had an amazing time here tonight! We had our Christmas party and the food was delicious! I especially loved the Apple Crumb with ice cream. It was so good it was sinful!'b\"This place was absolutely great. Our waiter was attentive and helpful with menu choices, and the food was great! We were seated right away even though we ended up 30 min early for our reservation. I had the linguine with clams in the white wine sauce and my boyfriend had the scrimp scampi. His was amazing and they give you about 20 shrimp! Mine was good but I think the red sauce is probably better. It was a little bland so a lot of parmesan helped :) \\n\\nGet the dessert sampler! It's delicious! Tiramisu, apple crostada, and the cheesecake were the best. The chocolate cake was really not great and kind of dry, and our creme brulee was runny and undercooked. \\n\\nOverall good prices and good portions! $73 for 2 entrees, a dessert, and a bottle of wine. I would definitely come back.\"b\"We got off to a questionable start as we were sat several minutes after our reservation time.  It was not a deal breaker, but it was annoying.  Our server was prompt and friendly.\\n\\nThe bread is very good.  It is hard not to fill up on it before your meal comes.  We ordered a few appetizers for the table.  I tried the mozzarella marinara.  It was surprisingly good.  Most places you can tell the mozzarella was pulled from the freezer right before it was fried.  The mozzarella here had good flavor, and the portions are good sized.\\n\\nTo start off my meal I ordered the side portion of the Maggiano's Salad.  I always enjoy this salad.  The house dressing has good flavor.  The blue cheese and bacon add great flavors too.  The portion is large.\\n\\nFor my main course I ordered the veal Parmesan.  The portion is huge.  It comes with a side of spaghetti as well.  The veal is ok as far as flavor is concerned.  I have had better, but it was fine.\"b'Wonderful food and service. We went there for our wedding rehearsal dinner a few months ago. Everyone had a great experience!'b'We made reservations for 7:30 and arrived about 45 mins before our reservation so we thought that we might get lucky and get a table early. We ended up not getting seated until 7:50 which we were not happy about because we had show tickets. We were so happy with the quality of the food and service provided that the issue with the long wait was no longer an issue. We will definitely be returning to the restaurant'b\"I went to this restaurant last weekend and had a great experience.  Everything we ordered was great and the service was excellent. It had the atmosphere of a very nice restaurant, and the prices were reasonable. I'll definitely be back!\"b'Stopped in for dinner during Presidents Day weekend and while very crowded and some delay the food came out hot and delicious. Still a great casual spot on the strip!'b\"I always loved going to Maggiano's while living in LA. I have to say my most recent visit  to the LV location will probably be my last. Reservations are a must, but the bar, reception, and dining areas are always so packed full of pushy people. The wait staff is so stressed out by all the drinks, bread, meals, desserts, and checks that they barely have a minute to be cordial.\\nI equate Maggiano's with romance-dark setting, big booths, great music and good food. Well, sadly the place has turned into family heaven. There was every age group of child from infant strapped to his dad's chest, to toddlers in strollers parked in the isle, to children throwing tantrums, to teens glued to their iPhones. Sorry to say, just the sights and sounds of all these children during my meal turned my evening into a spectator event rather than a romantic dinner. I suggest keeping the kids with grandma or the babysitter, but probably most of the kids we saw were tourists so I think I will just try my luck at a different Italian restaurant off The Strip.\"b\"A must have! My husband and I had the lasagna and the chef Mann's country style pasta- two completely different dishes but both equally delicious and comforting. Visually beautiful, an array of textures, and the smell.... Mmmmmm. \\n\\nThe staff was quick and courteous. We hardly waited at all for seating and food (we arrived at 3pm).  Oh and while we didn't take advantage of it this time- they offer a nice happy hour menu.\"b\"The food is absolutely amazing! Our waiter was awesome but the hostesses working tonight are horrible. No energy, no smiles, and they were very rude. They made me feel uncomfortable and I'm sure anyone else would feel the same. Like I understand you may not be working but you're making money so slap on a smile and fake it! These two girls would never survive where I work.\"b'I would have given it 5 stars but our first server was HORRIBLE!! I wish I could remember his name. Thankfully he ended up going home after our appetizers, and we got a new server! The food was delicious and very filling! We ordered the family style option, and it was way too much food for 4 people! We had yummy leftovers though!'b'Recently visited this place again for the second time. The food here is just so damn good, mouthwatering dishes I would say. Also, this place has a wonderful view to the strip and very nice customer service.'b'A much better and more reasonable priced option on the strip. It really captures the essence of an old school Italian joint and the food was excellent and reasonably priced with all things considered. We ordered the chicken marsala which was to die for as well as a ceasar salad and grilled salmo'b\"As far as chain restaurants go, this is one of my favorites. This particular location is awesome too, and I suspect because of it's primo Las Vegas Strip location, they are all trained to wow you with their service.\\n\\nI took the wife and kid here, and I was almost ashamed to do so because of the white cloth tables. This location seemed just a tad upper class, but alas we were hungry wolfpack. And I spotted a smattering of kids here so I didn't feel as bad later.\\n\\nOrdered the bruschetta, shrimp scampi, and classic spaghetti meatballs. All dishes were excellent,  esp the scampi. No complaints here. The bruschetta was super tasty, the tomatoes and olive oil made me feel like I was in Tuscany. Haha. Too much? Yeah.\\n\\nService was amazing. I didn't get the guys name but it was perfect. Friendly, but not fake, attentive, but not pyscho. Deserving of his 25% tip...only in Vegas right?\\n\\nAnyway, if you got an urge for Italian but don't want snotty service at a Michelen joint, come here.\"b\"After a long and tiring day at Magic tradeshow, the team came here to feast! I was pretty hyped since it was my first time. The 5 of us ordered the classic family style which was I believe $35 a person. Not that cheap, but do-able.\\n\\nService was utterly non-existent. Food took forever inbetween servings, we're talking about 20-25 min inbetween each dish...even appetizers..\\n\\nThat's pretty damn bad. As you could expect, we got full just sitting there, so had so much food non taken advantage of.\\n\\nMaggiano's...not a good way to treat the customers. \\n\\nIf I come back..and that's a pretty strong IF, I would hope they actually serve our table.\\n\\nMeh.\\n\\n-Goodfood.LA\"b'We ended up getting reservations here for our dinner, the last time we were in vegas; and I am glad we did.  The service was great! I want to say our servers name was nestor? but I could be wrong, either way... great service. we had the margherita flatbread to start (delicious) and our server recommended a  dush to me which was amazing.  it was nicknamed \"grown up mac n cheese\" but it was nothing like mac and cheese.  I rarely ever give a place 2 thumbs up or five star etc etc... but the food and service were amazing.'b\"This place was great. My Dad loves a good spaghetti and meatballs, it's his go to favorite meal.  And me myself, I LOVE Chicken Parmesan. We went here  when we were visiting my Dad in the fall. We had a great, amazing view of the Strip, and it was right as the sun going down... PERFECT.\\n\\nWe all had great food, and great service. I know it's a chain but it was still good to enjoy it and the environment was great.\\n\\nHopefully, next trip out to Vegas to visit me Dad, we can stop again.\"b\"It was New Year's Day, and another visit to Maggiano's.  This dinner really started the year off right!  \\n\\nRustic bread was very good, and golden Calamari Fritte was again excellent alternately dipped in a specially requested Lemon Aioli, along with a mild Marinara Sauce.  A filling bowl of Tuscan Chicken Sausage &amp; Orzo Soup was outstanding, and a small chopped Caesar Salad with a light and delicious Creamy Caesar Dressing, big crunchy croutons, and Parmesan splinters was nice and cool.\\n\\nAlthough we had to ask for one round of water refills, and Meat Sauce was first mistakenly brought to Diane's side of our booth, these minor lapses were quickly corrected, and otherwise service was excellent, as is usually the case here.  My entree of Spaghetti &amp; Meatball in Meat Sauce was very fine indeed, with a large dense meatball, al dente spaghetti, and a mild sweet sauce.  For Diane, Roasted Red Potatoes served on request in lieu of pasta were simply prepared and excellent tasting.  I asked for a few mushrooms to be added to my Meat Sauce, and they were.  There was no charge levied for this or the aioli, although I would have gladly paid for these graciously given extras.\\n\\nOnce again, five-star dining--on a holiday, when expectations are highest.  This time they were even exceeded!\"b\"The service was okay, had to ask the waiter for a refill on water after waiting nearly 10 minutes. The calamari was soggy but the portion was large. The tomato and basil soup was eh, but the Taylor Street Baked Ziti wasn't bad.\"b\"My first time dining at Maggiano's was in Florida a couple years ago. I fell in love with it! I came back home, to Vegas, and was unaware we had one here until I went to the Fashion Show Mall. They never cease to amaze me. From their freshly baked bread that's still hot when brought to your table, to their absolutely delicious 4 Cheese Ravioli, you can't go wrong dining here. Our waitress was this super sweet lady who was obviously from a different country. I can't remember her name, but she was the best. Couldn't ask for a better server. The hostess was a bit... Off setting. She didn't look very happy. But I've been a hostess before and I know how stressful it can be. A smile will go a long way though (:\"b\"This place has certainly changed alot, they use to have the best caesar salad and on our visit this past saturday, not so good, barely had any dressing on it.  Service was also very poor, I understand they are very very busy but we waited a very long time to get our bread.  Our waiter had not help from his busser.\\n\\nI don't like how you can no longer order small and large, food quality has definately gone down. :(\"b\"We went for Dinner and I made reservations on OpenTable which is super easy. We arrived and were seated within a couple minutes. The waiter came to the table and we told him that my wife has a gluten allergy and he said that would not be a problem and took our drink order and said he would be back to get our food order. When he came back he had the Chef who ask my wife what she wanted and said he could make pretty much anything she wanted and she decided on the Chicken Parmesan which she loved. My 11 year old got the Mama's Lasagna &amp; my 13 year old got the Fettuccine Alfredo and they both thought it was epic. I enjoyed my Veal Parmesan and instead of the Spaghetti I asked for the Fettuccine Alfredo and they said no problem. I have to say the food was good but the service was Great. My wife got the Creme Br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e for Desert which she always enjoys. It has become a must visit when we go to Vegas.\"b\"There's a Maggiano's in my hometown of San Jose. Strangely enough, I have never been to that place. So this was my first time ever at Maggiano's! Whoa.\\n\\nWe pretty much hit the jackpot with parking. The underground lot of the Fashion Show mall has several entrances, and although we entered from the south end of the mall, we found our way to the northeast corner (which was actually near an exit) and found a perfect, surprisingly non-wheelchair parking space very close to the elevator that takes you directly to the back of Maggiano's.\\n\\nAfter walking through to the host desk at the front, we got seated fairly quickly. It was a busy lunch hour, but not absolutely jampacked. We were seated by a window, thankfully, and we got to see some of the Wynn and Palazzo. I had a blast watching the Wynn divider move up and down the LED screen. Who needs a TV?\\n\\nI somewhat surprised myself for asking for coffee. I was dead tired from accumulate sleep debt this week, so it was worth every penny of the $2.95. Our server was funny though. He took care to turn the saucer such that the spoon and coffee mug handle were angled to my left, even though it's kinda assumed that most people (including yours truly) are right-handed.\\n\\nI have a lot of love for the Baked Eggplant Parmesan. So does my mom. She ordered it (and saved the leftovers for a special someone) along with the stuffed mushroom appetizers. My aunt went with the Linguini and Clams with white clam sauce, and I had the Veal Parmesan.\\n\\nJust like in most Italian restaurants, we got started off with complimentary bread with olive oil / vinegar dipping sauce. Nice crust on the outside and soft absorbent inside. What more do you want?\\n\\nThe mushrooms came out first of the orders, and they were delicious. Couldn't care less that basically bread crumbs and fungus (with spinach and garlic). According to my mom, the version she knows from San Jose uses a higher number of smaller mushrooms. I guess you gotta go big in Vegas though, and I didn't mind fork-and-knifing it. I thought that the parmesan cheese available table-side did enhance the flavor, which some might view as a shortcoming.\\n\\nI sampled some linguini too. It's pretty good, although the clam-to-noodle ratio reminds me strongly of ramen, in a not-that-appealing way. I like to have more of a balance of protein and starch.\\n\\nMy veal was nicely pounded, breaded, and fried and was sufficiently tender as far as that goes. The melted provolone and marinara sauce and the accompanying spaghetti were all great complements. I just realized that I didn't dust off my leftover veal with parmesan before leaving, which makes me a bit sad.\\n\\nOverall, it was good, solid Italian food. One of the best parts, really, was the view, which strongly correlates with the obvious Las Vegas Strip price markups. It's alright though - I would have been hard-pressed to spend the $50 in gift cards at another time. Yay for heavy reductions on out-of-pocket costs!\"b'The atmosphere is great, the food and wine were very good, and we got a great server as well! Was able to make an online reservation through Open Table for five people 30 minutes ahead of time on a Friday evening, which was awesome.'b\"Nous cherchions un petit restaurant ou s'arr\\xc3\\xaater un peu plus loin que les grand casinos, r\\xc3\\xa9sultat nous sommes arriv\\xc3\\xa9 presque au bout du strip devant ce centre commercial, il \\xc3\\xa9tait d\\xc3\\xa9j\\xc3\\xa0 une heure plut\\xc3\\xb4t avanc\\xc3\\xa9. Nous avons tout de suite trouv\\xc3\\xa9 que l'ambiance de ce restaurant semblais calme et pos\\xc3\\xa9e, exactement ce que nous recherchions. \\nNous avons donc din\\xc3\\xa9 dans ce restaurant et ce fut vraiment d\\xc3\\xa9licieux, le tiramisu est le meilleurs que j'ai pu manger, pas trop alcoolis\\xc3\\xa9 et plein de mascarpone comme je l'aime ! La quantit\\xc3\\xa9 est au rdv et le rapport qualit\\xc3\\xa9 prix vaut le coup\\n\\nJe retournerais a Las Vegas ne serait ce que pour ce tiramisu !\"b'The Location is perfect to travelers and night view from the window seats is wonderful. Average food quality is good, but some sea food menu, such as a  Linguini di Mare are extremely salty. I could not eat at all. However stuffed mushroom is the best!! I also like their happy hour drink menu. (3-6PM)'b'Very very good food, only tried a couple dishes butt they were outstanding and very fresh. The pasta seems to be made from scratch which is always a plus and the sauces are not overwhelming. Very good'b\"Came for a bachelorette party dinner.  There was about 10 in our group and opted for the family style menu.  We chose the classic menu which came with a choice of 3 appetizer or salad, 4 main courses, and 2 desserts.  From what I remember, we had the calamari which was amazing, the bruschetta which was also amazing, and the maggiano's salad the salad was pretty good.  For our main courses, we had the chicken parm. I was not really a fan of this dish just because if was overly breaded.  We also had the peppercorn crusted sirloin.  This dish was really good. The meat was tender and the flavors were good.  Along with our meat dishes, we ordered baked ziti and fettuccine alfredo.  I enjoyed the baked ziti but the fettuccine alfredo was too much on the thick side where the noodles clump up together.  The dessert we chose are tiramisu and creme brulee both were yummy. The creme brulee was on the little runny side but it was a really good runny kind.  There were so much food that we even had tons for left overs.  Everyone enjoyed their food before food coma sets in. \\n The service was very very very good.  The host was able to hold our table even past the 15 min hold time because our party was so late.  Our wait staff was so friendly and soft spoken.  She was attentive but not annoying.  She approached our table frequently but not too frequent.  Drinks were refilled  before they  even reached half way.  Overall, it was a great experience.  I would recommend this place for big groups who has a budget because to be honest restaurants at Vegas can get super expensive and not everyone can afford them.  Would I come here again??? Of course!! I am actually planning on having my family  bday dinner at the one in LA.\"b\"I found this restaurant by chance as my friends and I were walking down the street from our hotel towards Mirage hotel. At first, we thought it would be very expensive to eat there but since it's at the fashion show mall, we thought we'd stop by and check it out. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the prices were pretty reasonable (except Steaks which cost over $40)\\n\\nI ordered shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta and I loved it!! it was very light in garlic butter wine sauce and unlike most restaurant, they put a generous amount of shrimp in there, which was awesome! It was a pretty decent sized plate too, but I ended up eating every bit of it! Yumm! \\n\\nMy friends ordered the lasagna and they both loved it too. Good portion, very meaty, cheesy and delicious. (Yes, I had to take a bite for myself!)\\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of chianti for $36 (I think) and it was pretty good and went well with the food.  If you're planning on having at least 2-3 glass, that would be a better option than ordering by the glass which is usually $10/glass.\\n\\nAbove all, our server was really nice, friendly and fun. I think her name is Lori (?)\\n\\nTheir freshly baked bread was soooo good, nice, fluffy and warm. I am not really a big bread eater, especially before my meal, but I ended up eating 3 pieces - dipped in the olive oil vinaigrette and grated Parmesan cheese. Yumm!  \\n\\nWe didn't have a reservation so we were told we have a half hour wait. We were waiting for about 15 minutes but  luckily, we found a table at the bar, first come first serve, so we ended up eating at the bar area, which was just fine by us. They serve the full menu there as well.  They have a nice outdoor seating area as well. \\nI'd recommend that you call and make a reservation if you have a large group or don't want to wait to be seated.\\n\\nSooo, Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely going back there, to try out their seafood Linguine!\"b\"Went on dinner date on 4/14, made reservations greeter didnt even acknowledge that we arrived. Hostess saw that we were uncomfortable as she sat the table. Too many tables and one restaurant.I thought to myself if were with our other table next to us.anyways. .. Our server Stephanie was great very knowledgeable on the menu offered appetizers(Bruschetta)appetizer was out b4 bar drinks! asked for chilled martini's .actually came out chilled! Food  was delicious!!! (chicken piccata and chicken parmesan).stefanie offered us tiramisu as dessert was delightful! Thank u Stefanie for great service!\"b'Very tasty food, professional and very courteous waitress. Chicken parmigiano was excellent, strong drinks. Highly recommended.'b\"I have been to Maggianos about 3 different times but this last time warrants some shout outs. I graduated and wanted a place to go for my group of 10 friends and family. I found out they also have a happy hour that's offered in the restaurant so I made the reservation. \\n\\nWe were seated right away and our drink orders were taken almost immediately. The group decided to participate in the family style dinner. We had calamari, bruschetta, chopped salad, chicken parm, fettuccine Alfredo, Parmesan crusted tilapia, tiramisu and pound cake. WOOOO! \\n\\nThe best part of our meal was the very attentive and funny Jacob. He always offered us more food but everything was just enough for our group. He kept the drinks a flowing too and made sure this girl was happy, happy on her graduation day.\"b'My husband and I had our wedding reception here and thought it would be special torevisit it for our 6 month anniversary since our original impression was spectacular. Unfortunately our experience for our anniversary was the complete opposite.  Even though we made reservations our table was on top of the guests behind us. The service was virtually nonexistent;  we had empty glasses, we waited about 30 minutes for each course,  and when  finally got our food it was not as satisfying as our original experience.  Needless to say, we will not be dining with them again.'b\"The food and service was great. Our server, Rafael, was so helpful. He made several suggestions that helped us to decide what to order without breaking the bank or over stuffing ourselves. \\nWe reserved online, got there a bit early and got seated within a couple of minutes.\\n\\nRafael explained that anything and everything on the menu could be modified to our desire - different noodle, sauce, substitution of an ingredient, etc. So we ordered the seafood linguine and substituted shrimp for mussels. Came out totally delicious. Appetizers were $4 until 6:30pm so we ordered italian sausage flatbread. Delicious! We were too full for dessert but wanted a tasted of the Tiramisu - our favorited. Rafael suggested the sampler Tiramisu for a fraction of the regular price. We went for it and were surprised by the still good sized portion. Again it was perfect. \\nRafael also gave us suggestions for tours and shows. \\nOur experience was fantastic. We couldn't stop talking about it to our family and will try Maggiano's in San Jose\"b\"Great food, however this place doesn't build it's business off of customer service. If you have any special request forget about it. They don't have to worry about repeat customers in a location like this. Doesn't matter to them that you are spending a nice good amount of money to take your family out for a nice evening. We asked if we could sit on the patio... No, even tho plenty of tables. Can we sit by the window? (Vegas) if you want to wait 20-30 min... Again plenty of open tables. Guess what?? There's a lot of other great restaurants in Vegas!!\"b'Very flavorful food and very reasonably priced for Italian!! Portions are big &amp; you never leave feeling hungry. Highly recommend'b'My all time favorite Italian restaurant!  A must have is Rigatoni D.  A few other recommendations are four cheese ravioli, beef medallions and the spinach and artichoke dip.  Beautiful restaurant and very busy.  Make reservations on a weekend.'b\"Have been to this restaurant multiple times. Made a 6pm reservation and was seated promptly when arrived. My friend and I had the calamari app, rustic chicken pasta and veal parm. Everything delcious. Even saved room fro teh tiremisu desert which is probabaly one of the best tiremisu's I ever eat. Assad our waited was on top of things the whole time. made sure we always had everything we wanted and very friendly. I will ask for him next time I go. Only reason didn;t give it 5 star is because the items are just a tad bit pricey i think. I have noticed the prices inch up little by little every tiem I visit. But since this is a Vegas strip location, they can do this I guess, since more tourists than locals go here.\"b\"Classy Atmosphere and easy to get in.  I love the Veal Parm; expensive, but worth it.  If you have a bunch of friends come in from out of town, take them here and then go hit the casinos afterwards.  I got really lucky at the Venetian after a meal at this restaurant.  It's good luck ;-)\"b'The food is garbage; worse than Olive Garden yet similar to their variety.  Our waiter performed the functions of all the floor duties while the floor managers stood still, doing nothing; that made our entire dinner party very uncomfortable to see how much stress the waiting staff were under.  I would never recommend this establishment to any of my friends or family.  Is this representative of typical \"Strip\" food?'b'Restroom needed some touched up. On the way to restroom passing by bar area paper towel on the floor displayed look unsanitary. Plate for bread needed to be checked under for remains of food sticked in it. \\nPresentation'b'Love Love Love this place atmosphere is amazing food is always great! Highly recommend to locals and tourist.'b'The food was good...maybe just a little salty, but I\\'ve come to expect that from large chains.  and our service was good.  But seated next to us was a group of four 20-something men, three of whom were wearing \"wife-beater\" tank tops.  It was really disgusting.  I don\\'t expect suits and ties...and I guess these days in Las Vegas even a collared shirt is asking for too much.  But wife-beaters?!  It was gross.  I find it hard to believe that maggiano\\'s doesn\\'t have some minimum dress standards.  I\\'ll probably go back again one of these days, but if I see that again, I\\'ll leave.'b\"Good Italian food, for decent prices! Spacious and attentive service.  Highly recommend trying the patio, it's shaded and if it's not too hot out, should be a nice experience!  \\n\\nFried calamari, oven roasted pork loin, chicken parm and tiramisu are a must!\"b\"I ate here with my family and it was a great experience. The wait staff was very friendly and their reservation system is very efficient. I put in my reservation at 8:30 and they had us seated before 9 even though the place was packed. Their food is great too. We got calamari (easily the best I've ever had), stuffed sausages, and mussels as appetizers and 2 types of pasta as part of the group menu deal. Dessert was some tasty cookies.\\n\\nThere was a friendly old man (not sure if he was staff or someone they hired to come in sometimes) singing to couples and people who had birthdays. At one point, the whole restaurant sang happy birthday to this guy with fake Elvis muttonchops. The atmosphere was very comfortable.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place and I will definitely eat here again!\"b'Second time to this Maggiano\\'s... The first time we sat on the patio and I swear a cockroach bit my leg. SOOOOOO GROSS. I don\\'t think that\\'s the restaurant\\'s fault... The interior appears very clean. Came here for dinner the other night to meet up with a friend at 7pm but hadn\\'t called to make a reservation. My boy and I got there a little early so we put our name down (wait was 30 mins, nbd) and took a seat at the bar. The bartender took a minute to get to us but was friendly and made an AWESOME drink for me. Moscato Mojito. Definitely try it!!\\n\\nWithin 10 minutes, our buzzer went off for our table. I brought it over with my still nearly full drank-drank but had to wait like 10 more minutes at the stand to be seated. I get that it was much faster than the 30 minute prediction... But don\\'t tell me my table is ready then make me wait again while with a drink in hand. Whatev. \\n\\nWe were seated, our server said he\\'d be right with us. Our server came back and took our drink order. We ordered 3 of those moscato mojitos (one extra for our late friend lol). I\\'m telling you! Try it!!! Our friend showed up shortly after and we got our drank-dranks. Server asked if we\\'d decided on our meals yet... Our friend just sat down.... Give us like 2 more minutes? Ok cool! He came back like 15 minutes later. With bread and oil. We ordered and asked for vinegar to go with the oil. He never brought it....\\n\\nMeanwhile the table next to us had sat down 5 minutes after us and was being served their food. Again, I get that we were taking our time and our friend was late, WHATEV. But their server was ON IT. I was able to get his attention and asked for vinegar. It took him 12 seconds. I was so jealous of the table next to us. \\n\\nFood finally came like 30 minutes later and I was a little disappointed with the size of the salad that my boy and I agreed to share because it was \"enough for two\"... Maybe enough for two kids. My ravioli and side of broccolini were really good tho. Our server came back 10 minutes later to ask if we needed anything. I was gonna get a dessert but after waiting forever for our meal and having never gotten vinegar from him, I decided to pass fearing it would take too long. Just the check thanks! Ugh. That was another 10 minute ordeal. I don\\'t recall him thanking us or looking forward to our next visit but that may have been said...\\n\\nOverall, 3 stars only cuz our service was slow and spotty. Memorable I suppose but not for the right reasons. Food was good. Nothing to write home about but satisfying. Dranks were BOMB. I\\'ll go back just for that Moscato Mojito! Better luck next time though, Maggiano\\'s.'b\"First time here last night and had a great experience! Our server did a fantastic job in my opinion she was very attentive and personable.  She wasn't overly formal which is a weird pet peeve of mine. Our waters were always full, drinks refilled and table clean.  \\n\\nOnto the food. We started with the zucchini appetizer which was all kinds of amazing! They were lightly dusted with parmesan cheese and served with a lemon aioli of some sort. Very delicious. My boyfriend thought they had a little too much batter, but I thought they were perfect. We asked for a side of marinara or meat sauce with the app and our server gladly brought us a little of both. They too were very good! Very different from each other which I thought was nice.\\n\\nI ordered the Chicken Francese, I think that's how it's spelled, with angel hair pasta instead of the potatoes. It was a lemon chicken with a parmesan crust and what I would describe as a light creamy mushroom sauce. Idk but it was good! Not too lemony or heavy on the sauce and the perfect portion. I saved one chicken breast to take home because I wanted some later.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the rigatoni d which he was really disappointed with.  It had an odd sweet flavor to it. We took most of it home with us and never touched it after that. \\n\\nOverall it was a good experience! I definitely will be back to try something new!\"b'we recently went here for lunch.The food was awesome and delicious.Our waiter was courteous and extremely efficient. Portions and drinks were huge.Highly recommend.'b\"I honestly feel that this place was overrated. I always get people that tell me that this place was awesome which I don't agree. Its also overpriced for what they give you a dinner for two here is a hundred bucks. I feel like I can get more for my money somewhere else sorry to be blunt but I eat out alot so if Im going to spend that kind of money I should feel satisfied right?\"b\"It's safe to say, I'm a Maggiano's regular. &amp; I think the Vegas location is probably the best one- overlooking the Strip, yet safely located in the Fashion Show mall &amp; not quite 'on the Strip'. Fun for people watching during the day (love sitting outside, if not too cold, hot or windy!) then transforms at nite when the 2 windowed walls facing the Strip allow you to dine alongside the buzz &amp; beauty of the Vegas lights. While ambiance is a factor in why I like Maggiano's, consistency is the reason I go back time &amp; time again. I don't believe I've ever had a bad meal or experience there (other than occasionally being sardined on busier nites). Unbeknownst to me, at some point, Maggiano's even changed ownership; I couldn't tell, because unlike other cases when there's an ownership change, nothing about the quality changed. I'm part of their email list so I get emails with coupons every couple months. A few no-fails on the menu: tomato caprese, stuffed mushrooms, rigatoni d (though not great for leftovers, because of the cream sauce), mom's lasagna (had it for the 1st time last nite &amp; it's one of the best, not too mushy), eggplant parm (generous portion), the best chicken parm I've ever graced my mouth with &amp; linguine di mare (substantial seafood). For dessert, if you're still feeling gluttonous, go for the apple crostada... otherwise, we generally get the kids scoop of vanilla bean icecream with hot fudge. Also, keep Maggiano's in mind for Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas dining, if you're in town visiting or if you just don't feel like cooking- they do a wonderful job with the menus &amp; you'll surely have leftovers, for a reasonable price. It's easy to mosey in &amp; be seated right away for lunch but I recommend reservations for any time after 4:00.\"b'Tried the Saltimbicca chicken and it was like nothing I have ever tasted. The dish was full of flavor (sage and other herbs) tender (perhaps pounded?) in a perfect mix of sauce. Wow! I normally go with the tenderloin medallions but glad that I ventured from the beef route. Oh, and the bread--addictive, so delicious.'b'The food is really good I had the rigatoni D and Chicken picatta it was DELICIOUS. The reason for the 3 stars was the service the waiter was trying really hard but they were super busy it was just to much for him or anyone. But worth a try just make sure to have a reservation upon check in oh and the view is amazing'b'Good Italian food. A tip they need to fix that elevator from parking garage takes forever (a good 5 min) to come down and when its 100+ degrees outside and everyone is dressed nicely (dresses &amp; suits) and starting to sweat profusely ummm it is not cute!'b\"Not a bad chain restaurant with a bit of a hometown feel.  Portions are generous, prices reasonable, and service is friendly, makes this an acceptable place to go in the northern/central part of the Strip (Fashion Show Mall).\\n\\nOrdered the Linguine di Mare (seafood), it's a decent dish with mussels, shrimp, bits of lobster with pasta in a tomato based sauce.  It's a huge portion but what's up with the tons of mussels?  Extreme dis-portion of mussels, which is more than half of the seafood.  I like mussels so that's ok with me, others may not be so happy.  The noodles need to be cooked longer in the broth as the flavors are not completely absorbed.\\n\\nFor desert, ordered the tiramisu, very light and creamy, with a strong coffee accent.  This would be a good choice.\"b\"We ate there during our last trip to Vegas. I loved their eggplant Parmesan. Nick our server was great. We ate outside on the patio. The service was great. The manager even stopped by to ask us how our food was. I loved their mist outside to cool us during the hot weather.\\nThey don't offer the take one home meal like all other Maggiano's. I could've used it.\\nNevertheless a great experience\\nHighly recommended.\"b\"Very good comfort food with all the regular Italian fare you're accustomed to. This isn't going to be anything out of the ordinary, but if you're looking for a good-solid place to take a group while you're visiting the Strip, this is it. Great views and patio seating is available.\"b'Love this place. Service was great, we came and got seated right away, very attentive and helpful waitress/waiter. Like the atmosphere as well, as I can see the Palazzo/Venetian hotel. Ordered the shrimp and crab canneloni and it tastes amazing. I can savor every bit of crab and shrimp in it plus the cheese and special sauce that they use, so good. See you soon Little Maggiano thanks for the delicous dinner..'b'A coworker recommended this place and I am sure glad she did! After a long day of travel, this place really hit the spot. The patio was nice in the evening and not too loud with street traffic. The calamari was delicious, as we the mushroom tortellini and eggplant parm. The food was rich, delicious and flavourful as very well priced, especially on the strip. \\nThe sangria pitcher was a little disappointing though. It had a ton of ice and the server put a ton of ice in our glasses as well. it really diluted the flavour.'b\"So impressed!! We were here for my husbands birthday dinner, and everything was amazing.\\n\\nWe ordered filet mignon and the lobster carbanara. Our food came to our table HOT. (I hate when it comes to you warm or semi warm. I don't want it sitting in a window.\\n\\nWe also tried the calamari. It was the best we have ever had.\\nOur waiter Assad, was great. Our drinks always filled, and overall great service. JHe even brought my husband a small bday dessert. \\n\\nPortions are huge! Food is fresh, prices are good!\\n\\n\\nWe wiill be back!!\"b\"We Chose the Make A Wish meal for two. Enjoyed crab cakes as an appetizer, happy hour-Long Island Iced tea. My partner enjoyed pepper corn crusted sirloin, I had crusted Tilapia. Creme Br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e and Apple Carmel sauce w/ vanilla ice cream. FABULOUS . Come get us we can't move! Enjoy. PS Ask for Seidi's tables..she's so cool.\"b'We enjoyed the meal greatly as a late afternoon dinner with my sweetheart.  I ordered the Make-A-Wish special (for 2) with Lump Crab Cakes as a yummy appetizer), Peppercorn coated Sirloin with twice baked potatoes, a Long Island Ice Tea (Happy Hour special for only $6) &amp; Creme Brulee as dessert.  My sweetie ordered the crusted Tilapia as her entree with an apple dessert covered in a caramel sauce. They may be a chain restaurant,  but they are of excellent quality on every point!  Seidi (from Estonia) was our server and she is totally fabulous!  Everyone from the hostess that seated us, the gentleman that brought us water and prepped our booth to the wait staff was friendly, and seem genuinely interested that we had the best experience possible.'b\"It was horrible. We haven't been on a date in a while and we thought this would be a good place to go. We were ignored the whole time. The waitress didn't refill our glasses the whole time until the end when she gave us the check. The wait was really long especially for a Monday evening just to get our food. The portions were small. The waitress didn't give us our bread when we asked or the vinegar. Overall really bad experience. Never going there again.\"b\"Maggiano's is a very nice restaurant. The service was excellent. The food was very appetizing. There's plenty to eat when you order a family style meal with a party of 4 or more. Will come back again. I recommend this place to everyone visiting the Las Vegas strip.\"b'I visited this place a couple of years ago on the recommendation of my friend Missy.  she loves the Newport Location, so I was willing to try it out.  \\n\\nAMAZING!!!  I make it a point to east here when in vegas.  This might sound strange, but they have one of the BEST Crab Cake appetizers in the world.  I have ordered this as my main course and nibbled on my husbands food on a few occasions.  The portion size is HUGE.  We have done the Family Style meal and it was simply too much food.  We could not keep up!!!  All in all, the location is nice, the food is great and the location is convenient.'b\"Maggiano's is a good place! The service is great. The food is appetizing. My boyfriend and I enjoy sitting in the outside area with the strip view.  We always have a few cocktails and share some good food.... and people watch! Great place to spend an afternoon!\"b'We dined here last night with a party of 10.  Ordered the family style dinner and were very impressed.  Brandon took very good care of us the whole night.  We were never rushed and the food just keep coming.  The chopped salad was great along with the stuffed mushrooms.   Dinner was eggplant parmesan, salmon, chicken picata and sausage with gnocchi which all were excellent.  One of our diners had some dietary issues and they were VERY attentive to her.  Dessert was amazing my favorite being the apple pie.  Everyone in our party was very impressed!'b'Dined here for a special event.. Our party were approached be a highly rude and inappropriate blond middle aged woman who, stated that our entire party would have to wait in the heat for 30min for a table when there were numerous free tables with no reservations. Both woman (hosts) were extremely rude and unaccommodating which baffled our party as this has been the worst service and experience we have encountered since arriving in the USA. Do not waste your time or money on such rude people as this has left a sour taste in our mouths.'b\"Maggianos is a family atmosphere restaurant, with a good location, great food and excellent service.\\nIf you're looking for that restaurant where you want to fell comfortable with the whole family this is it, I come here every time I'm visiting Vegas with my four years old daughter (of course she knows how to behave in a restaurant). \\nThe location is perfect, specially if you're planning to do some shopping since is located right there at the fashion show mall and if you're  lucky you might get a table with a nice view of the Wynn and Encore casinos across the strip.\\nThe food is great,  some of my favorites entrees are the Lobster Carbonara, the Rigatoni D and the Chicken Manicotti, all good and  the portion of food is more than enough.\\nThe excellent service is based on my last visit. I made a 7:15pm reservation but we arrived about 20 minutes earlier (Vegas traffic unpredictable). I asked them if we could be  seated and in less than five minutes we were already enjoying ourselves. Nestor was the name of the waiter, he was there when needed with suggestions of appetizers, wine and desserts. Simply GREAT SERVICE!!\"b\"Attempted to book Maggiano's for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Dealt very briefly with the booking coordinator named Lori who was so unprofessional that I would not have booked this venue even if it was the LAST restaurant in Las Vegas. I am a local business owner and I am shocked at how a restaurant like Maggiano's handles their guests.  Extremely disappointed since I have used Maggiano's in the past for graduations, etc.\"b'We love Maggianos Little Italy.  We used to go to the one at South Coast Plaza it is awesome! But now that we have moved we are closer to Las Vegas Maggianos is at Fashion Mall across from Wynn.  They do a great job even being crowded! Food and service are great! You can park right under the mall and there is an elevator to take  you to italian heaven!'b\"I cannot rave about this place enough. I only ever get to a Maggiano's on vacations. This time did not disappoint. We went with a party of 6 and had the family style experience. Chopped salad, crab cakes, and gnocchi with sausage to name a few dishes. Everything was perfect. Wait staff was pleasant. A violinist came to our table and even took some unusual requests. Great experience. A must try!\"b\"I have always been a fan of Maggiano's. I first went to one of their establishments over 10 years ago in Chicago and have gone to that one probably ten times since. When they opened one in Las Vegas I was happy to go there as well and have frequented it many times since then. \\n\\nMaggiano's is one of those rare restaurants that overfeeds you meaning they serve huge servings which is very hard to usually finish unless you're super hungry. \\n\\nOn our most recent visit we got Spaghetti and Meatballs, Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Piccata, sauteed spinach, and mashed potatoes. As usual my family had a hard time devouring all the food. My niece was overwhelmed by the huge serving of shrip scampi as was my son with the spaghetti. I was just able to finish off my dish of chicken piccata. \\n\\nNeedless to say that we are fans of Maggiano's and it is always on our list of restaurants to visit when in Vegas.\"b\"Based on a recommendation from some good friends my wife and I gave this place a try a few years back, and every year we make sure this restaurant is a part of our annual Vegas trips. \\n\\nThe service is always stellar and friendly. The prices are decent as well.  The portions are perfect for sharing and you just can't help but savour the wide range of flavour each dish presents itself. There is both a subtly and boldness with each pasta dish. We leave full and content but not bloated and overstuffed like you can at some pasta places. In some ways this is a nice escape from the Fashion Show mall, the views from the restaurant are wonderful, as you sit across the Wynn and the places offers a bit of calm from the strip itself. \\n\\nI have had a few dishes here over the years and so far each one has been wonderful. Try something yourself as I am confidant that you will experience the flavours and enjoy the atmosphere as much as we do each year.\"b'Pretty solid place.  Everything from the service to the lobster carbonara were very satisfactory and thoroughly filling.  I would definitely be back and recommend the place to others.  The portion I took to-go for the next day held up as well.  Good stuff!'b\"The food was amazing! We had the spaghetti and meatball and could not be happier! The only reason I won't give 5 stars is that our waiter was horrible. We sat for a good 15 minutes without him refilling any drinks or taking our order. But we requested another waitress and Sarah was amazing! She more than made up for the lack of service. If everyone was like her it would be a 5 star for sure!\"b\"When it comes to italian this place is my favorite in Vegas ! Great place to take a date or your whole family, please be smart and make reservations because with quality food like this there will be many people there. Lets talk about some of my favorite things to order.\\n\\nRight from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had! \\nSome of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta, a simple but very tasty plate, the chopped salad or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are 100% Sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go! \\nAs for main course you can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home! My favorite, though it is another simple classic dish, is the spaghetti and meatballs i absolutely love it! The chicken parm is fantastic as well! In all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review!\\nNow for desert, if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go, it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well! \\n\\nI strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress, once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize! Also as i said dont limit this place to only dates its great for the whole family with large portions attentive wait staff and a lot of class ! 5 stars and truley a gem! \\nEnjoy :)\"b\"Darn good Italian Food! Probably some of the best Italian food I've had since I left NY...Other than waiting an hour to be served, and a long hike to get there, worth the wait and exercise. Staff was good and fast (especially the english talking waitress)...Music was Frank Sinatra like, and there was even a guy walking around asking to sing personalized music...Looks like I'll be having my wedding reception here...Let's see...Forgot to mention, I was even watching the Orioles play, and talking to my wife to be as well...She actually thought I was listening to her...What a bonus!\"b'Very delicious Italian food. Great views of the strip. Get a table by the window! Could do without the random serenade guy walking to every table to get tips for singing to you, but it is a unique touch. Very enjoyable experience in all.'b'I\\'ve actually been to Maggiano\\'s a few times and when I did it was amazing!  The food, the atmosphere, the service was phenomenal!  However, this review will be on my recent visit, just a couple days ago.\\n\\nMe and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job.  In the beginning, everything was fine.  We ordered our appetizers and... that was it?  He didn\\'t ask if we\\'d like an entree after taking down our appetizers.  So, we waited for our server to come back and ask if we\\'d like to order an entree.  After he gave us our appetizer and even finished it, all we saw  him do was helping every other customers but us.  Did he have something against us because we \"look\" 16 years old and can\\'t afford an entree???  After about 20-30 minutes of waiting, we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree we\\'ve been waiting for.  He comes over and he goes, \"Okay go ahead.\"  He didn\\'t apologize for making us wait.  REALLY??  Wow.  I\\'m appalled by his performance.  And after we got our entree, he only came over to us twice, third time being check, and we never saw him again.\\n\\nThe saving grace to our experience was the food.  Our appetizers were the Zucchini Fritte and Stuffed Mushrooms.  I loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great!  Our entrees were the Rigatoni D and Chicken Parmesan.  He enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well!  The little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat!\\n\\nWe\\'re always going to come back here.  Just not have that older server again.'b\"I am giving this restaurant 3 stars because I was in a larger party (under 10 ppl)  but the forgot one of the orders. They did comp that meal but if you're hungry and ready for dinner it sucks to have to wait. \\n\\nMy meal came out on time and it was delicious I had the Chicken Francese. I loved it! Pretty filling and not too heavy which I appreciated since I was going to go out later that evening. I love pasta but let's face it, it's heavy.\\n\\nI would definitely visit this location again, good servers and good food. Remember if the party is too large, they make you dine family style.\"b'Just another chain restaurant Caesar salad and the food server at the table dropped the balsamic oil which splattered on my new shoes!'b\"It was ok Italian food, but I've had better. The pasta was uninspiring. The family style dinner is a really good bargain, highly recommended for a group.\"b\"I found this place on yelp 2 years ago and every time I intend on coming it never happens...today I made sure it was the first thing we did...\\n\\nHer\\nShrimp scampi for her with vodka cream sauce\\nAngel hair pasta . with a tomato soup.\\nPeach ice tea\\n\\nHer remarks were....this is the best vodka shrimp pasta I ever had. (She's had it in a lot places) lol.\\n\\nMe\\nChicken Marsala with angel hair with chunky spicy tomato sauce.\\nStella Artois \\n\\nMy thoughts\\nThis was def killed olive gardens version of it lol.\\nEverything was great.\\n\\nAlso dessert sampler was also epic. \\n\\n\\nNicole was very nice and had a lot of menu knowledge... Thank !\\n4 stars !!!\"b\"My first time here at Maggianos and I have to say the service is great. I had the mom's lasagna and  enjoyed every bite, also the portion size is big enough to feed two.\"b\"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. We were able to get a seat quickly. \\n\\nBread service was my favorite part. Balsamic vinegar in Olive oil to dip the bread. Yummy!!!  \\n\\nI had the fettuccine Alfredo while my husband had chicken Parmesan. Huge portions that we had wrapped up for later. Our daughter inhaled her ravioli. Included in her kid's meal was ice cream. Instead of shouting out about the ice cream in front of our daughter our fabulous server asked my husband discreetly if it was ok for her to have it. Loved that!!!!!! \\n\\nPrice was decent. Food was terrific. Service was fabulous. Definitely recommend.\"b\"We went to Maggiano's to have dinner after a wedding. The room had been reserved in a beautiful private wine room. The food was delicious. The service by Bob and Jeremy was outstanding. They even brought in a iPod with music so the bride and groom could have a first dance. I highly recommend this place. I am from San Diego and I can't wait to go back again.\"b'You have to try the Maggiano salad. This had to be the most delicious salad I have had in a long time, and I am not a salad person. The peach Bellini is delicious. The homemade bread was excellent. I got the bow-tie aglio chicken special which was good but a cream sauce really would have made the dish better. The orecchiette and scallops are excellent!'b'We held our wedding ceremony and reception for 90 people in the banquet rooms at the restaurant.  The experience was virtually seamless and beyond our expectations.  The response time and efficiency of the process was impressive.  Our questions and concerns were addressed at every turn.  We chose the restaurant based on pictures and the menu we found on line. My husband decided to take an earlier trip to \"taste test the food and see the space\"... as well as golf.  He came back raving about the food and assured me that I would love the venue.  \\n\\nThe first time I stepped foot into Maggiano\\'s was on the way to the alter and I can say, it blew me away.  The atmosphere is so beautiful and romantic.  The food and service was absolutely amazing. The menu options are by far the best value money can buy in Vegas.  You definitely will not go away hungry.  We still get compliments from my guests and we can guarantee they will all be eating at Maggiano\\'s on their next visit to Vegas!\\n\\nIf you are considering Maggiano\\'s Little Italy as your venue of choice, you won\\'t go wrong!  We do, without hesitation, recommend to everyone we talk to, to have a meal at Maggiano\\'s.  It is perfect for parties of all sizes and you will definitely impress your guests.\\n\\nThank you, thank you, thank you! For everything!\\n\\nSheri &amp; Bill'b\"I used to like Maggiano and think it was one of my favorite Italian chain place. However, I have not been back to this place for at least 3 years because there are so many Italian restaurants in town. I came back last night for my friends bday and found out they've changed their menu quite a bit. I guess my palate has changed as well and became more picky. I wasn't completely satisfied. \\n\\nI was surprised that they don't have any pesto sauce on any dish. They also took always the half/ full size. They only have one size for their entrees  now where it's more for individuals rather than sharing. I guess that makes more sense for the restaurants on the profit sides.\\n\\nAfter I sat down, it took the server 10 minutes to bring me some water and then another 5 or 10 minutes to take my drink order. Even though I was the only one who arrived in our table, I was bit annoyed by it. The server was friendly though. I wasn't sure if they were under staffed or he's just keep forgetting about me. \\n\\nI was not impressed by any of the pasta we tried. We tried fettuccine Alfredo, gnocchi and Italian sausage, and shrimp scampi. Alfredo sauce was not creamy enough. I like the vodka cream sauce in gnocchi but gnocchi was overcooked. I don't think I will return anytime soon.\"b\"Rigatoni D never disappoints! As well as the flat breads,  can't beat the happy hour!\"b'Came with a big group of 20 and enjoyed lunch very much. Everyone liked it. \\n\\nThey put bread on the table with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The bread was very good...crispy outside and soft center. \\n\\nI ordered the Lobster Carbonara. The pasta was cooked al dente, as it should be.  The sauce was creamy and tasty. It has pea pods instead of single peas, which I liked better anyway. There was plenty of big chunks of lobster throughout, and only a few pieces were the opposite salty, bitter side of the claw.  Too many restaraunt slip those pieces in instead of the sweet delicious side of the claw. Not this place....plenty of real sweet lobster. Yum!\\n\\nA little pricey, but the portions are huge, atmosphere elegant, and wait staff superb. So worth it!'b'The service was excellent and as always the food is very good.  The server always refilled the glasses and the good came out quick.  At the end of the meal grab a few of the mints.  They are awesome!'b'First of all, the mints were delicious! They sat us where we wanted to sit in a very short amount of time. \\nThe food was tasty and the service was great! The drinks were refilled in a timely manner and so was the bread. \\nWe had a great view of the strip! :) \\n\\nAgain, I grabbed a handful of mints on my way out. Lol'b'Took wifey and little one out on a lunch one afternoon after strolling in the mall. I finally decided to check this place out for what it really is.\\n\\nI ordered the lobster carbonara while wifey got the steak with mushroom for lunch. As for her dish, she said she loved it! The mushroom gravy was very rich and being the fact that she loves mushroom it was all worthit from her aside from me who is not a mushroom eater. LOL! As for my lobster meal it was an excellent dish, little one and I shared it and the portion is huge for a lunch meal so two person can share it if theyre not that hungry.\\n\\n5 stars for the food and minus 1 for the service it was very slow. I needed refill but the waiter never seem to care and just kept passing us by.'b\"I loved everything about my visit minus the waitress. Although she wasn't horrible. I ordered the famous Rigatoni D which was Delishhh! I will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Vegas.\"b\"My wife and I had a great meal here.  It's not like we make at home but we were very happy with it.  Portions were large and the price was great.  Two entrees and a glass of wine were only 40. Our server, Nick, could not have been nicer.  No complaints about this place.\"b\"So first off, I enjoyed their outside seating area they were very quick to sit us down on a Saturday night. Were quick to get our drink order and it quicker with our food, the calamari for appetizer was glorious. I had the lobster carbonara and I absolutely loved it, keep in mind there actually big portions so I wasn't able to finish it. Got a to go box for sure, you don't let good things like that go to waste. My friend got the ravioli,  he was pleased with but seemed like a smaller portion it had like six or seven or so raviolis seem to fill him up though. Bread they brought out with the balsamic  was amazing I now want to go to the store and do that for myself. I very much enjoyed this last night and intend on going back, today I went to Hooters for lunch and even though I'm stuffed from it I have the lobster carbonara in my fridge I refuse to go bad so that's what I'm eating now, i'm a fat ass.\"b'Went here  on a Friday afternoon for lunch. Wait time was not bad, in fact we were seated fairly fast. Greeted by everyone when we walked in, so no complaints on friendliness.  Place was clean and well orginized. \\n\\nOrdered\\n\\nChicken fettuccine alfredo with asparagus. -  Great flavor. \\nMushroom Ravioli - so so. \\n\\nOveral this place, to me, is comparable to olive garden. Nothing too mind blowing, or distinguishing. Would much rather pay the price at a Tony Romas. Customer service was better than expected. Not a bad try at all.'b\"Love their lighter fare option! While yes, Maggianos is known for their large portions and ahem, rich (calorie laden) flavors, this was a nice surprise. I had the chicken piccata and thoroughly enjoyed it! I didn't think any of the flavor was lost, but yes, the portion was a bit smaller than what I'm used to there. However, it was still filling.\\n\\nHubby had the linguini de mare, which was really good (not lighter fare). We started with the Maggiano salad (him) and Italian salad (me) and both really enjoyed our respective orders.\\n\\nWe shared the toasted pound cake with caramelized bananas for dessert and it was deeeelish! \\n\\nOur server was Seidi and I highly recommend asking for her section. We eat out quite often and the service we experienced from her was the best we've had in a while!\"b\"AWSOME, AWSOME, AWSOME. Everything we had was wonderful. One of my favorite dishes is cannelloni, and they have now set the bar. Please do yourself a favor and try this place out. Don't forget the tiramasu to finish it all up. We will return the next time in Vegas.\"b'The service was phenomenal.  Our waiter was perfectly pleasant, witty, and attentive.  The food was incredibly delicious, and the pricing was very reasonable.  Be prepared for a considerable wait without reservations, but I would highly recommend for anyone visiting the Las Vegas strip.'b\"Honestly the food is 4 stars, the service was fast &amp; friendly but I knocked it down to 3 stars because of the atmosphere. We went in planning on having a romantic dinner for our anniversary and instead it's like we walked into a big family dinner party. And it maybe fun for some I found it a bit overwhelming. Soon as we walked in we had to walk through the dining room maze and to the middle of the crowded restaurant which is expected at 630pm Saturday night. But it was the layout that just crams everyone together. Unless you're in a booth it's pretty much like you're eating with the other tables next to you. It was so loud that I had to shout over to have a conversation with my hubby. It wasn't loud music it was just having so many people in one room talking, even the guy who serenaded us with a guitar I could barely hear and he was right in front of me.\\n   As for the food, awesome! I got the lobster carbonara and it was delish. Lots of lobster, cream sauce was tasty and huge portion, only complaint is a little too much Parmesan cheese that it kinda hides the flavor of the sweet lobster. Hubby had chicken Alfredo and loved it but couldn't finish it (rarely happens). Got the sampler for dessert and it's must if you can't decide on one thing. \\n  Overall not a bad place for good Italian food with family &amp; friends but definitely don't recommend for romantic dates.\"b\"Great place to eat! The only thing that keeps this a four star review is that our waiter is never around. We were seated at the patio (nice outdoor area overlooking the entrance of the mall) and after putting down our menus he didn't return. Eventually one of the hostess took our order for us. Our food eventually came but we were not given any utensils, and our water was not refilled throughout our meal. \\n\\nThat aside, the food is very delicious and reasonably priced. I love their pasta and they have cheap pasta options or nicer seafood pasta options. I'm a big fan of cheese so the I love the meal here. Arguably better than the buffet options on the strip which costs too much!\"b'Good solid Italian food.  We had eaten here once before, again with some of our kids.\\n\\nThe food was very good.  As described in the menu, except the dressing on the salad was extremely salty; we all agreed that if we ordered that salad again, no dressing (or on the side).  The prawns in their signature red sauce were generous in portion size, and excellent.  The calamari fritti (sp?) were also very good.  The wine list, while not huge, had some very good values.\\n\\nService was a bit uneven, though always friendly and apologetic with regard to forgotten items.  Would eat here again, but order a bit different.'b'This was my first time coming here, we were coming here for one of my close friends birthday. It was a party of 20 of us, good food and decent service. For it being my first time I had the WORST experience. To be coming to a nice restaurant you\\'d expect great service. We asked our server Carolyn if she can split our check. Working at a restaurant myself,knowing she can split the bill, she told us it would be easier to pay on one bill. We all thought gratuity was included since it was a party of 20. When she gets all our checks she asks us if anything was wrong or if she did anything wrong. We were all confused and she said to us \"well I see a bunch of zeros on the checks, that means I don\\'t deserve a tip\" that was unnecessary and unprofessional on her part. And the ones that had paid on card we\\'re going to tip her cash.We would of all gladly tipped but after she didn\\'t deserves it. She embarrassed us all and the birthday girl. I wish she would of got the manager like she said she was going to. So if you get a server named Carolyn make sure to tip her so she won\\'t go off on your table.'b'Took my girlfriend here last night for her birthday and had the greatest service by the waitress! Very attentive and sweet! The food was delicious, the drinks were on point and the birthday dessert was incredible! One of the few restaurants on the strip that I would rave about :)!!'b'The food was so good and authentic. \\nOne of the best Italian food I eaten\\nHighly recommended.'b'Everything was Better than I expected!!  JEREMY and BOB made our small wedding reception so special!!  My husband and I could not have asked for more.  The arrangements and the Barolo Room were PERFECT for our family and friends!! We were all impressed by the wonderful food and atmosphere!!  We would do it all over again and again!!  We will definitely be back for many anniversaries!!  \\nThanks to Everyone!!'b\"The customer service was excellent. We were sat and the waiter was very friendly. The bread was soft and delicious. I ordered the four cheese ravioli...and the flavor was a bit bland but I added some more seasoning to get it where I wanted. Not sure if I'll be back but if I need a Italian spot, I don't mind coming here.\"b'We made our reservation on Open Table and walked over from the Trump.  We were seated right away.  The service was very good.  While we were walking to our seats we noticed the portions were very generous.  My wife and I split a salad an a meal and it was more than enough.  Some might think it was cheesy but, my wife and I thought the strollling guitar player was a nice Vegas touch.'b'Let me start by saying we sat at the bar because the restaurant was very busy and ere glad we did ... Outstanding service! To the food I had chicken &amp; shrimp al forno it was outstanding my hubby had the lobster carbonara nothing left on his plate and he also finished mine ,no room for dessert but the people next to us had cheese cake and look delicious.'b'Great Italian food, Great service, what more do you need? \\n\\nOrdered the family \"classic\" style to share between four of us. There was wayyy too much good food to share! I was stuffed before the desserts even came out! Not sure if you are allowed to bring food home or not considering the family style menu you can keep asking for more as much as you want, but our waiter was nice enough to let us take the desserts home. \\n\\nThis place can be on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for: great food and great service! Highly recommend!'b\"the staff and service where decent \\nwhat really really lacked was the food it's self\\nmaybe growing next to little italy in nyc has me spoiled because that food is cooked by real Italians\"b'Not the best place to go if you\\'re trying to eat healthy haha BUT when it\\'s a friends birthday and u kind of have to go the restaurant does offer \"lighter fare\" options and glutten free options. My gripe was not being provided with correct nutritional information, I feel like I annoyed the guy when I asked. And my food was good just tasted kind of salty. Ehhh. I\\'ll try it again tho someday.'b\"I really wanted to love this restaurant... But I didn't. My husband and I were craving Italian food while on vacation in Vegas. This place didn't do it. The service was slow. The appetizer and bread were delicious, but the entr\\xc3\\xa9e's were not. I swear my eggplant parm tasted freezer burnt. Hubby's lasagna was just ok.  Our server was bad. I could easily hear him use the same line to sell dessert to all of his tables. Maybe the dessert was good, but I wasn't buying it. Save your $ for another restaurant.\"b'This is a review for the service.\\n\\nI was there with a large party this past weekend. One of the members had specific eating needs, and a reservation was made well ahead of time so that the party could be split into 3 tables of 8 each in order to not do the family style eating. Again, the restaurant had agreed to this specific arrangement a number of months ahead of time.\\n\\nOnce we arrived, the restaurant did not honor this original agreement. We were told that it would have to be family style eating. A number of us had no desire to eat that much food, and were unhappy about being charged a mandatory price for food we weren\\'t going to eat anyway. ESPECIALLY as the restaurant had agreed to allow us to order individually.  \\n\\nThey kept reiterating that is was for our \"benefit\" as we would get food at different times unless it was family style. We kept repeating that this was not an issue for us--we just wanted to be able to order individually. So we sat there for an hour, as one person after another discussed it with the servers.  One of our group finally was \"allowed\" to speak with someone in authority, at which point they relented and allowed us to order individually. An hour. It took an hour before they would agree to follow through with the original promise.\\n\\nOverall, it was a lousy customer service experience. The restaurant tried to back down on their agreement, and then tried to out wait us. Just terrible.'b'Last night was me and my boyfriends last night in vegas.. We asked our server Corinna  what was her favorites  and she told us the beef madalions and lobster pasta (cant remember the name) omg died and went to hevan after the frisf bight..beef was soo tender didnt need a knife and pasta was so cheesy  and delish. Plus you get warm rolls with butter and vinegar  and oil. Sk as the dinner came to an end we had left overs so she boxed them up for us and put in free lemon cookies. All around best service  thank you Corinna'b\"One of the best locations on the Strip. If you go for dinner ask to sit in the main dining room (floor to ceiling windows facing Encore &amp; the Wynn.). For lunch, I prefer the bar, especially if there is a game on.  Today, a couple of glasses of Pinot and the soup &amp; 1/2 sand... Chicken meatball, killer.  Do it!  Maggiano's LAS rocks. Park underneath at Fashion Show.\"b\"I really cannot give this place any stars except for one and that was because the server went above and beyond. \\n\\nThe food was horrible. The calamari was left under the heat lamp and was chewy. Why so much iceberg in my salad. We had chicken marsala, and the chicken was so over cooked that I couldn't chew it. We had a fish course and although the fish was cooked perfectly,  it was luke warm. All in all, the experience was not what I would have expected. Next time I choose to drive that far for Italian, I'll pay a little more and go somewhere else.\"b\"After reading reviews, we decided to book my sister's wedding cocktail reception at Maggiano's in Vegas. It was one of the best decisions we made!!\\n\\nWorking with Beth, Assistant Banquet Sales Manager was awesome. We emailed back and forth prior to our October 13th reception. She was easy to get a hold of and very helpful. \\n\\nWe had 25 people attend the reception. They put us in the DiCarlo private room. We decided to go with the 2 hour reception, all you can drink/ appetizer food menu. You can't beat the price!! Beth asked how would we like the room sit up. I told her that majority of the people will be standing around socializing but I wanted the options for guests to sit! We had 3 high tables and 2 low tables for people to sit. Worked out perfect!!\\n\\nWe arrived a little early. So we made our way to the bar, which was large! When the married couple arrived, they felt special that their name was on the board when they came in. When you walk into Maggiano's it is very elegant. \\n\\nThe 2 severs for our party, I forgot their names but they were excellent!!! The drinks were flowing and the food was coming out!! Our guests are drinkers and probably were very needy... I never felt the servers were annoyed! They were in a good mood and accommodated us!! They were very nice too!!\\n\\nThe food was amazing, no one complained!! THANK YOU CHEFS!!\\n\\nMaggiano's allowed us to have a dock station to play our own music! \\n\\nSince no one was in the other private room we were able to go on the balcony to make toast and and take pictures! The balcony is awesome! I actually wish the party was out there!\\n\\nThe manager stopped by at the end of the night to see how everything went! We couldn't have thanked him more for an unforgettable wedding reception! Our friends and family are still talking about how they enjoyed the wedding reception!\\n\\nI especially recommend Maggiano's in Vegas for a wedding reception! I can't wait to come back and get dinner here! !\"b'Our server was absolutely incredible! He was very attentive to our needs and kept an amazing conversation with us. The food was delicious as well. I had the ravioli  and my husband had the chicken Marsala! We will definitely be returning!  I love their bread too!!!'b'The mussels in the spicy tomato sauce was superb as well as the shrimp scampi the desert sampler was five ok the best I have had. Our waiter  Brandon was wonderful helped with suggestions. Recommend this place highly'b\"The atmosphere in this place is quite nice, very low lighting. It seems great for big family events, with a number of big private rooms. It's great because you have a perfect view of the lights and hustle of the Las Vegas Strip. I ordered to go but had a glass of wine while I waited for my food to finish. The servers seemed really nice for the most part, although I didn't get the full service since I was ordering to go. \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp fra diavolo (lighter version) with a side casear salad. The food was packed very nicely and thoroughly saran wrapped to keep from spilling. The salad was OK. Nothing too extravagant. The pasta was a nice portion, perfect to get full off of and then have leftovers for another meal. Also, they were very generous with the shrimp. Sadly, some of the shrimp tasted a little undercooked. I wasn't sure but the next morning when I was sick it was confirmed! Definitely may think twice before ordering seafood here!\"b\"Had such a great first experience at Maggiano's!! Our server Nicole was amazing. We wanted to eat somewhere before our show at the Wynn. We knew that it was our own fault for running a little behind, but when Nicole found out that we were on a time limit, she made sure that they had everything out for us in a timely manner without us having to ask her. We were not expecting that at all. She gave us suggestions on what to order and what not to order since certain items take longer to make. She kept checking up on us and our waters were always filled. Portions are big (family style is an option as well) so we ended up ordering an appetizer, one pasta dish, and then dessert. Soooo good! We will be back\"b\"One of my top fav restaurants. Food is always full of flavor, the bread is amazing, our servers are always checking up on the table, and even on a busy night, I can still sit down and have a comfortable dinner with whomever I go with. Always a top choice when I'm debating where to go eat for dinner\"b'Very delicious food.   I ordered the Caesar salad and chicken franchese.  Wife ordered the house salad and chicken Alfredo light style.   Both dishes were cooked perfectly and was tasty.  The complimentary bread was also fresh and good.'b'This place was absolutely amazing! Out waiters name was Dave. He treated us so well. Answered all of our questions and gave us amazing recommendations. We ate the stuffed shells, spaghetti and meatballs, and lasagna and it was spectacular! The food came out so fast, and we were starving. I will definitely be back to this place very soon!!'b'My friends &amp; I had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at Maggiano\\'s as the lunch reception for their 10-year wedding vow renewal. We had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. There was plenty of room for a display table as well. And there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip &amp; Encore. They had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived &amp; they corrected it before the families arrived). Overall the service and the experience was a positive one. I think it\\'s safe to say the guests &amp; celebrants enjoyed their time at Maggiano\\'s. I\\'d advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. My friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. So convenient...\\n\\nNow on to the menu: First course was stuffed mushrooms, calamari &amp; italian salad. The stuffed mushrooms were good. They were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. They were served in a white wine sauce. You cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn\\'t disappoint. Fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. Just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you\\'re golden. The italian salad was surprisingly delicious. Salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis &amp; croutons in italian dressing. Good appetizers. I enjoyed every single one of them. \\n\\nSecond course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken &amp; shrimp and chicken marsala. I loved the meat lasagna. But really, what\\'s not to love? It\\'s lasagna! And it was classically delicious. They don\\'t call it \"Mom\\'s meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. Crumbled meatballs &amp; sausage with ricotta cheese. Boom! I didnt have the rustic chicken &amp; shrimp but my friend\\'s seemed to like it. The chicken marsala was so very good. White meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. It was the perfect chicken dish. I loved it the most... And that\\'s saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. Order it. Trust me.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had 2 offerings. Chocolate zucotto cake &amp; Nonna\\'s toasted pound cake. All I had was the toasted pound cake &amp; that\\'s all I needed. It was so damn good. Crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. Game over. I dont have to tell you how good it was. You already know. \\n\\nYou\\'re welcome...'b'We had an awesome dinner here! \\n\\nThey seated us right in the window on the strip. Great view!! Fabulous service!\\nThe food is really good, classic italian. The best in the city? No, but a great place to go, especially if you have friends visiting and staying on the strip and want to meet up with them. They make it really easy, valet right in front of the elevator!\\n\\nMake a reservation, it gets really busy!\\nAnd ask your waitperson for food guidance. They know which way to direct you through the big menu!'b\"We came here to celebrate our daughters 21 birthday. This was a big deal for us and we had the entire family in tow.  Had a reservation for 11 at 7:30 PM. Called in the afternoon to see if we could move up to 7 which they were able to accommodate. Got there and the atmosphere is great. Just a couple minutes and they seated us. Food was family style and amazing. I can't even remember all the courses but there was sublime mozzarella cheese, artichoke dip and bread for appetizers, sirloin, chicken, lasagna and Alfredo and amazing dessert apple frittata was crazy. The waitress was fantastic, completely attentive and helpful in her suggestions. One down was table was in close to other patrons, bumping chairs issue. Probably because we moved up our reservation. One person at the table next to us was total rude jerk (I paraphrase for this review) toward my daughter which came close to ruining the evening, but that wasn't totally restaurants fault. Managers stepped in and gave us a private room to be sure the rest of our night was perfect. This place is top notch, don't hesitate to let management know if you have special request. They're very cool and want to make your experience the best it can be.\"b'as always, excellent service with excellent food! date night with \"canvas &amp; coppola\"!'b\"Came here for my husband's birthday dinner. Made a reservation and was seated promptly upon arrival. Server was nice,  but definitely seemed rushed. \\n\\nComplimentary bread and butter / olive oil, which was probably the best part of dinner. \\nGot the crab cakes appetizer, which was tasty.  I ordered the beef tenderloin medallions and husband got chicken marsala. My entree was tender and cooked to perfection, and tasted good at first,  if a little monotonous. \\n\\nHusband's (birthday boy) entree was a total failure. He asked to substitute the standard spaghetti aglio olio with spaghetti meat sauce,  which didn't happen. The chicken was as tough as shoe leather, the sauce didn't taste at all of marsala wine,  and the mushrooms had hardly any evidence of being cooked.\\n\\nConsidering we were here for his birthday,  it was pretty disappointing. Still, service was nice enough, and location, and cleanliness can't be faulted.\"b\"I always leave here wishing I could eat more. After the flatbread pizza and the fried mozzarella, I'm usually stuffed before they bring out the giant portion of chicken parm. I've never had dessert, as I'm already bringing home a ton of food. \\n\\nThey seated us in the corner with all the windows. Great view of the Strip and plenty of people watching during the meal. Very efficient waiter.\"b\"I hate to have to give a below 4-star review when the service is extraordinary.\\nOur waiter, Kevin I believe (Im sorry if I get the name wrong but he's tall and talks quite fast), was super attentive and helpful.\\nHowever, the food wasn't very impressive. The lobster carbonara was quite bland and very liquid-y. My friend said her gnocchi was quite flour-y. \\nConsidering the great ambiance, the great service, and the great reviews this place's got, I expected more from the food.\"b\"We waited almost an hour for lackluster food that barely rivaled Chef Boy Ardee. This place is a shadow of its former self and its origins from Chicago. They've managed to accomplish what other big chains avoided - mediocrity. Skip the drama and head to places like The Cheesecake Factory which, while not enlightened, delivers quality food with quality service at reasonable prices. Maggianos Las Vegas just doesn't make the cut. Skip it.\"b'Pluses: Inviting decor/atmosphere, good food and cocktails (which were fairly reasonably priced), and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Minuses: Even though we had reservations, it still took 20 mins before we were actually seated and we had to wait in two different fusterclucked lines - people were bumping into each other and unsure where to stand or go (numerous signs for the \"Host Stand\" were borderline comical, giving an Alice gone through the looking glass experience - but with annoyed tourists); we asked the seater to speak to management (we were there for family celebration,and the evening wasn\\'t feeling terribly \"special\" with this first impression), who didn\\'t appear until 50 mins later (that\\'s because she never bothered to contact himl) - the manager was extremely defensive, admittedly he was probably slightly broadsided by our complaints but still seemed barely receptive to the criticisms and made repeated excuses about \"the layout of the restaurant\" and told us we should\\'ve came in via the revolving doors that we almost got whacked with twice because \"most of our traffic comes off the Strip\" (we\\'d already explained we were locals, apparently we shouldn\\'t come in where the valet is). All in all, we\\'d have been better off going to a nice local joint like Chicago Joe\\'s - this place was basically a fancier version of the Macaroni Grill.'b\"Again and again this place don't stop to make me want to come back here! \\nThe food is so good and delicious so I will definitely come back here again with friends and family.\"b'The food and service was great . The meat sauce was amazing. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is we dined outside on the patio and the ash trays for smokers are rite there in front of the doors and patio. So we got to enjoy cigarette and cigar smoke while eating.'b'The portions are very generous, well worth the price.\\n\\nMy fianc\\xc3\\xa9 and I ordered the Caesar salad and Four\\nCheese ravioli to share. The food was savory and appetizing!\\n\\nGreat restaurant for a date! Food and service were up to par! We would definitely recommend as a wonderful place for large and tasty portions with awesome service!'b\"Maggiano's in the Fashion Show Mall knows how to consistently produce high quality Italian fare. Over the years, I've eaten here many times and have never had a bad plate. \\n\\nTheir Holiday Season menu adds to the variety and decent wine can be had at decent prices. I had the braised ribs off the seasonal menu and they were extremely good. Likewise, the cab off the holiday menu is a decent $50 bottle...and they give away a branded carafe for using the menu.\\n\\nTip: for easy access, use valet parking on the north side off Fashion Show Dr. then hop into the exterior elevator for a quick ride to the restaurant.\"b\"This place isn't always crowded. The food is great and wait times for seating, ordering, food, etc. aren't bad. I've been here three times for lunch during the weekday and weekend and their prices are reasonable for being so accessible from the strip. I bring my out of town guests here and my aunt likes to come eat here whenever she visits (all the way from Oklahoma!).\"b\"Came here for my birthday a couple of days ago and really enjoyed it. The bread came out fast and was so good because it is handmade in the restaurant! It was nice not having to starve while waiting for our appetizer and entrees. \\n\\nAlso the customer service was great! Even though he was waiting more tables he was very attentive and courteous. \\n\\nThe food came out hot and fast and tasted great! We couldn't finish our pasta because we were so stuffed! They have large portions and my pasta was only 15 dollars! About the same price as Olive Garden but it was actually delicious. Believe it or not, our total was cheaper than the time we went to Olive Garden! \\n\\nFrom the time we arrived to the time we left it was only 40 mins! So I'd say service was extremely fast, especially since they were busy that night. I will go again if I'm in the mood for Italian (:\"b'Good location for Italian on the strip. We came here after a long evening of shopping in the mall. I highly recommend getting their lite chicken marsala if you are on a diet. Service at the bar can be shoddy but the food is great. Also, try out their stuffed mushrooms for appetizers.'b\"We made a reservation on Open Table for 7:45. We arrived and were told that it would be approximately 15 minutes. I could tell they were busy so we said no big deal. Then at 8pm we were told another 20 minutes. It took a total of 25 min after our reservation in which to be seated.\\xc2\\xa0I wasn't so impressed with their attitude either. \\n\\nOur service was great once we were sat though.  Seidi our waitress was great. She made some recommendations and my husband and I were both completely satisfied. I had the chicken piccata and he had the parmesean. She recommended the lite on each and the hand made pasta was to die for. Definitely changed my pasta opinion as this was my first hand made pasta. Wonderful. \\n\\nAlthough I wasn't too impressed with the snotty hostess team, the rest of the staff changed my opinion as well as the meal itself. I feel bad only giving a 4 stars due to the first impression.\"b\"We have eaten here over Xmas and it was fantastic! This is how Italian food should taste. The mom's lasagne was glorious as well as the desserts :))\"b'The food here is terrific, but high calorie. It is very busy pretty much all the time, so make reservations. Our server was inexperienced (forgot to bring my drink), but made up for it with a pleasant attitude. I would recommend this establishment.'b'We were impressed with the ambiance and decor. The rooms were full if energy and the food was great! Our servers satisfied our every request.'b\"Came for New Year's Day. Can get busy. Make a reservation. Don't be afraid to ask if you don't see it on the menu. The chef can usually whip it up. Love the Chef K Lobster carbonara , chicken parm, Lasgana, bruschetta, tomato soup, and chocolate cake! Also have requested a broccoli, chicken, and garlic pasta. Wonderful!! Big portions. About $1-2 more per meal than your other Italian chains but so worth it! Stephanie was our server. Local girl who knew the menu and could manage her time and the crowd. Would love to have her again!\"b\"Best Italian food I've ever tasted. Went here on years eve with my wife and daughter and it was super delicious.  We ha stuffed mushrooms and chicken Parm and the 4 cheese ravioli with a Side of spaghetti. I wish I would've took pictures of everything we ate everything was super delicious I recommend this place to everyone who goes to Las Vegas to stop by this restaurant. And when you're leaving I recommend you to grab a handful of the little chocolates they have on a lil basket they're the bomb.\"b\"Came here on  Sunday night just as a walk in had forgotten the reviews recommended to make reservations. Place was packed, waiting time was 45 minutes for a table of two. Waited at the bar had the best red sangria I've ever had. Also ordered the calamari, was not rubbery it was lightly crispy! So delicious. Bread they gave was too hard. Service was Excellent. \\nFinally got a table service was fast &amp; friendly. The food was delicious too we got the spaghetti &amp; meatball and seafood plate a little spicy and so buttery. Overall the entire experience was Excellent. \\nCome prepared to wait this place is booming!!\"b\"Another year later, and another New Year's Day meal at Maggiano's--this time with friends.  Food was as fine as usual, but this time there were just too many service errors to overlook.  I had to separately ask for more bread three times, and butter another three times before they were finally produced.  A table knife was taken away without substituting a replacement, and no serving spoon was provided for potatoes.  So one star was lost.\\n\\nComplimentary Italian bread had a nice doughy texture.  Calamari Fritti with Marinara Sauce and specially requested Lemon Aioli featured perfectly cooked golden tentacles and rings.  And Mozzarella Marinara consisted of four rectangles of slightly browned fried cheese.  \\n\\nA side Caesar Salad with requested anchovies was crunchy and excellent.  And a bowl of Tuscan Chicken Sausage Soup was very good except for hard included celery.  Fontina Potatoes were oozing with white cheese, and my entree of Linguine &amp; Clams with White Clam Sauce, 12 Littleneck Clams in open shells, and several pieces of chopped clams was quite delicious.\"b\"Always make a reservation, it's super quick and easy on open table! I came here for a quick dinner with my man on a Sunday. It was pretty busy, and it took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come over and greet us after we were sat. When I've already completely decided my meal before I've even been offered a drink, I get a little impatient. That's the only reason I knocked a star off. The food came out within 20 minutes or so after we ordered, and we split chicken piccata, but unfortunately they didn't split it. I don't mind paying a split charge, especially when I specifically request a split. The size was ok, only 3 very small chicken breasts, but Macaroni Grill has definitely made us spoiled with portion sizes. I would return, as it was a nice atmosphere at a good price with decent service and yummy Italian food.\"b'Good location! Right outside the Fashion Mall and on the strip! The hostess was really nice and the environment set the mood for a nice Italian dinner. Do NOT order the Alfredo with chicken. The chicken was at room temperature.'b\"I spend quite some time during the week at Fashion Show Mall for various reasons and Maggiano's is a tough place to beat. Every dining occasion I've had here has been more than enjoyable. \\n\\nWe were seated right away and our server this time around was great. I was impressed with how often he checked up on our table and he took the time to hold a conversation with our family.\\n \\nI tried their lobster carbonara and their chicken flatbread has always been a favorite! If you haven't tried, this is worth a share around the table. \\n\\nFood is always prepared as quickly as possible but still maintains its quality and taste. Will definitely return for many meals to come!\"b'This is my go-to Italian restaurant whenever I am near the strip or shopping at the Fashion Show Mall. This restaurant can be both casual and fancy at the same time. Either way, they are welcoming; but the wait time can be long so I recommend getting a reservation if necessary, especially during weekend nights.\\n\\nYou get complimentary bread in the beginning after you order, but don\\'t eat too much of it because the dishes are pretty big. I have ordered the \"Famous Rigatoni \\'D\\'\" couple of times and the \"Peppercorn-Crusted Sirloin\"; they were both good! The Rigatoni can get really heavy because of the Marsala cream sauce, but don\\'t get me wrong, the flavors are all there. The mushrooms &amp; the chicken go really well with the pasta and the sauce.  \\nLast time I went, I got the Sirloin cooked as medium, but it was pretty chewy so next time I get that, I will be sure to get it medium-rare. I had to cut them into little tiny dices to get through them. The garlic mash potatoes that were on the plate added a nice touch to the sirloin. \\nI never have room for dessert when I eat here because the proportions are pretty big! But it fills me up so I\\'m not complaining. The waiters are all so kind here, but the noise level can get really high, especially if there is a large group of people sitting in the middle celebrating a birthday or whatever. Besides that, I\\'ve had pretty good experiences with Maggiano\\'s!!'b\"Cant say how much I love maggianos. The servers here are always the friendliest people and so helpful with pictures!!! Coming here on my Vegas trips have become a tradition. It's walking distance from the Wynn and trump tower so it's very convenient since driving on the strip is such a hassle. The food is not the healthiest but will hold u up during the night. I would NOT recommend getting their salad though because it's like the salad out of a dollar bag from the store and very plain.\"b\"We were planning on eating someplace different until our car decided not to work.  \\n\\nIt was fortunate that we were staying at Encore and decided to walk across the street to the Fashion Show Mall.\\n\\nWe tried to eat at Grimaldi's and we walked all the way over there only to find out that it's only pizza now.  We walked around and found Maggiano's by the entrance we entered when first got to the mall.  We looked at the menu and figured it looked good.  We went to the reception desk and were told it was an hour wait.\\n\\nI asked about the bar area and was told it was all open seating as long as everyone in the party was 21+.  We walked back to the bar and found a high table to sit.  After 10 minutes, we were greeted by the smiley Nicole.  She said she would be our server and took our drink order.  She brought our drinks back, then disappeared for 20 minutes.  We wondered what happened to her since she seemed like a good server.\\n\\nWell, Nicole stopped by and asked if the other server had been by to help us.  We said no, so she apologized profusely and said she would take care of us.  Thank goodness she did.  Nicole is a very good server, attentive, and responsive.  (There was a miscommunication between her and another server as Nicole was going to hand us off to the other server).\\n\\nAfter the mix-up was cleared up, Nicole gave us top-notch service the rest of the evening.\\n\\nI had the spaghetti with meat sauce and replaced the spaghetti with rigatoni.  It was a very good dish and I almost finished the whole thing.  My friend enjoyed her linguine with clams in white wine sauce.\\n\\nOverall, a very good experience at Maggiano's.\\n\\nXie Xie!\"b\"I have visited numerous Maggiano's locations over the years and have loved every visit...until this one.  Maggiano's has always delivered an excellent, consistent product.  This visit the service was not outstanding.  We ordered the chicken sausage soup which was served cold.  I also ordered the lasagna (which they're well known for) which was also served cold and the sauce was nearly flavorless.  I would've been more satisfied with a Stauffers frozen lasagna.  I hope the Las Vegas location management does some serious quality control, trains the staff, and realizes that Vegas is a very competitive market before they're out of business.  I'll be looking for a new Italian location in Las Vegas.\"b\"Ugh. We came in for dinner on New Years (1/1) and seated ourselves in the bar area. \\n\\nYes it's busy. I mean holiday in Vegas? Drink like. The hubs and I swung by Vegas just to see what the type is all about. \\n\\nMy fave Maggiano location is South Coast in Newport. It clean, food is favorful, great texture, and well attentive and high class staff.\\n\\nThis Vegas location. We were highly disappointed. I ordered the frutti de mare. Fancy sh!t right? Man, my entree was salllttttyyyyy. My blood pressure and sodium level just increased - nurse dilute me! My husband got the lasagna and we shared he appetizer of calamari. It tasted reheated or microwaved. \\n\\nOur drinks were the best of the night - a coke and a glass of wine. Prepared directly by the company. No chefs needed. \\n\\n$70 wears our tab and I shake my head to this restaurant. We should stick to our all time fave homey mainstream Italian - Buca di Bepo instead!\"b\"Went to this location on Saturday for my son's birthday which I had already specified on the reservation. Anyways our server was either Mac or Max, can't really remember the name of a server who really wasn't to attentive and didn't even offer refills on our drinks or acknowledge that we were there for a special occasion. When out server brought over the check he asked if we wanted to order dessert and I said well I don't know let's ask the BIRTHDAY BOY? Hello didn't that ring a bell for our server no! He event asked if my son wanted to see the dessert menu! I was thinking this is the moment to redeem yourself and bring over a complementary dessert like the one all the other servers where bringing over to the tables celebrating birthdays!!! Any who I'm rating it a 3 because the food was honestly yummy even though our server sucked (two thumbs down for him) I do recommend this place for good food unfortunately bad service.\"b'I know...the first question you are probably asking is, \"with so many famous restaurants on the strip, why are you eating at a chain.\" We had just arrived and wanted something light and close to our hotel. We love their salads so we went. We found this to be a great Maggiano\\'s. Service was some of the best that I have received at a Maggiano\\'s. Prices seemed a little higher...but it is the Strip, what do you expect. Great views of the strip also.'b\"I have been to Maggiano's two times. They have some tables that are right next to a window that has a really great view of the strip which I liked. Most people want to sit there so there is a wait time that can be pretty long. I ordered the chicken parm. And it was really good. They also give you a lot of food which a lot of restaurants don't do anymore. Its a very nice restaurant and will deff. be going back.\"b\"Hard to imagine. Great quality, awesome service, reasonable prices, in LAS VEGAS at a chain? Yes! Maggiano's. I don't know what else I can say. The ambiance was country club. Menu selection was Superb.\\n\\nOK it wasn't a quiet little bistro. it's located on LV Blvd. In Fashion Show shopping center. But the food is good and you can easily splurge on the wine or drinks, and still save a ton over the big name places, eg. Batali's B&amp;B, etc.\"b'Ok, so my husband has been here about 4 times, \\nThis is my first time here...\\n\\n4 stars for parking \\n    5 stars for it being free\\n    -1 FOR IT STINKING like crazy down there (WTH!?) \\n5 stars for speed of service and seating\\n5 stars for the beautiful view of the strip (from where we sat!) \\n5 stars for menu options \\n4 stars for quality of food. \\n3 stars for price. (It IS on the  strip)\\n\\n 1 appetizer\\n2 entrees\\n2 drinks \\n$75 bucks \\n\\n\\n\\nThank you, Maggianos, because my husband is a fan, we will probably be back.'b'Again, a restaurant with excellent food spoiled by poor service.  Owners *must* send undercover relatives or friends to investigate how their staff is running *their* business as ongoing quality control. Our waiter was wonderful--knowledgeable and helpful, but a bad experience with a front of house staff who sent two of my guests away (knowing I was waiting for them and where we were sitting, and losing the restaurant money) soured my experience and I doubt that I will be back. Sadly, I could have thrown more business their way.'b'We went to Maggianos for our 1 year anniversary.at first they seated us in the middle of the restaurant at av wack table so we asked to b seated at a booth and they moved us with no problem....our Waiter Mark was on point and very cool..I highly recommend this place off you want a delicious Italian meal at a reasonable price...I highly recommend the calimari and salmon oscar BOMB... 5 Stars definitely'b\"Located in the Fashion Show Mall on The Famous Las Vegas Strip. Ok so let me start with this, and it's admittedly a personal bias, I don't really like pasta, I mean it's boiled dough for gosh sakes. Also I don't like to order chicken at a restaurant unless it comes in a bucket. That being said there wasn't a whole lot for me here, but I will say that everything is prepared with care and the service was good. If you like pasta go for it, if not there are plenty of other choices it is Las Vegas after all. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!\"b\"Ugh. We came in for dinner on New Years Day (1/1) and seated ourselves in the bar area. \\n\\nYes it's busy. I mean it's a holiday in Vegas right? The hubs and I swung by Vegas just to see what the type is all about. \\n\\nMy fave Maggiano location is South Coast in Newport.

We should stick to our all time fave homey mainstream Italian restaurant - Buca di Bepo instead!!\"b\"We thought the food that Maggiano's was very very good. Both my wife and I thought the sauce was excellent and the best we've had in sometime. But the service left something to be desired. Although when we brought the subject to the attention of the manager he corrected the situation promptly overall we give the restaurant a good rating and we do plan on going back again\"b\"The only good thing about this place is the excellent staff and the ambiance the food is horrible. A friend of mine came from out of town so I took her out there I was so disappointed with the food the shrimp scampi was ok, their salad indifferent and their veal parmesan was horrible. What next time? Bc there won't be one\"b'service was great, the food is ok to less than ok'b'We went to Maggiano\\'s for my birthday. The food was good, although I felt like my steak was drowning in gravy. It\\'s not something I\\'m used to - maybe that\\'s just how it\\'s prepared. My wife referred to her pasta as \"perfectly cooked\". It\\'s tough to please her, so that  means something! The margarita flatbread was AMAZING. Hands down the best food of our entire Vegas vacation.\\n\\nThe service was great. Our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing. He came with what we needed, asked if we needed anything, and was off. I like that. Now, I need to say something special about the service. The table next to us was very rude to our waiter over how the sauce was presented - not prepared, just presented. He handled it very well, as did the manager.\\n\\nLittle tip: make a reservation. Otherwise you\\'ll be waiting longer than you\\'d like.'b\"Food was decent - nothing too great. Three of us had the Famous Rigatoni D - I don't know why it's famous: it didn't taste like much, the sauce was very liquid, chicken was bland. One of my friends had the eggplant - it was fine. Overall, three stars. Service was nice, prices are decent for the strip.\"b\"I just held my wedding reception at Maggianos and they were fabulous! I was planning from a far because I'm from Canada.  There was more than enough food for everyone and I also opted for a bar package and it was worth every penny. The waiters always made sure my guests had a drink.   The mushroom di ravioli was to die for! Maggianos also helped me with getting floral centerpieces, they were fairly priced and have great longevity! Also I had some guests with food allergies and the chef came and spoke to those people personally and accommodated for them.  Great value, good size portions and excellent staff.\"b\"Went for a late night snack/meal at 9:30 in the evening. Just soup and salad. Everything was good, service was good, seating and for a chain restaurant I'm always impressed how un-chain this restaurant tastes. Just good food! Portions seem huge to me too. Everything was clean, even under my table and the window sill.\\n\\nWe ate inside, but the outside seating was heated seeing the evening air was chilly. Looked nice too.\"b'Food was good, service was as well.  Not outstanding or remarkable,  but what you come to expect from this chain. You always know the food and service are good no matter what location.'b\"My co worker and I arrived here during the week for lunch. I parked in the parking structure of the mall which has a elevator that takes you right into the back of the restaurant. We requested to be seated on the patio which gave us a great view of Las Vegas Blvd.\\n\\nOur waiter was prompt in getting our beverages, rolls and recommended the lighter four cheese ravioli which I ordered. For being a lighter entr\\xc3\\xa9e it definitely didn't lack flavor, was filling and tasted delicious. My co worker went for the salmon sammie and also enjoyed the food. Heart the ambiance here and the old style Vegas feel especially with the Sinatra music.\\n\\nOverall a splendid lunch with a great view. I definitely will be returning here again!\"b\"My boyfriend and I celebrated our early Valentine's dinner here (this is also where we had our first date!). I love the atmosphere here as well as the service. Our waiter Nick was amazing. He knew the menu like the back of his hand and had great recommendations. He constantly checked up on us to make sure we were doing okay. Food is always on point and I love their drink selection.\"b'Went here with a co-worker for lunch a few weeks back. had heard really great things about it. The appetizer we ordered was the smoked bacon with ricotta cheese on bread - highlight of the meal it was fantastic and our waiter had recommended it. I ordered ravioli and it was pretty average (I think CPK and Lavo have better). Service was excellent and it was pretty busy at the time. Will maybe come back but the food was mediocre.'b\"Amazing Italian food, incredible service and a great atmosphere! Besides, who doesn't love to hear Frank Sinatra in the background?\\n\\nWe love this place! We usually just sit in the bar area and have drinks and appetizers and whatever we order is always full of flavor, a hearty serving and tasty! A few things I would recommend, the Maggiano's Salad with a delicious house dressing and crispy prosciutto, the mussles with red sauce that is spicy and sweet and makes you want to pick up the bowl and drink it! The flatbreads, bruschetta, sausage and peppers, stuffed shells and chopped salad are also top picks. \\n\\nEven if you are feeling like you need to unbutton your pants as the server asks you if you would like dessert, say yes!! We ordered the mini sampler and every little delectable sugary bite of creme brulee, apple crostada, chocolate zuccotto bites, tiramisu and cheesecake were perfect. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back. Salute!\"b'Perfect! Couples can enjoy delicious single entrees and families can enjoy family style! Delicious.'b\"Came here two nights ago to celebrate my besties birthday. I love that you can take an elevator from the parking lot directly to the restaurant, so gangster. The restaurant's view is gorgeous and the ambiance has a sexy feel to it. The only thing I was not a fan of was the red and white checkered table cloths. Such a beautiful dining room overlooking the strip, soothing jazz music playing in the background with those table cloths...\\n\\n\\nOur server was very friendly, down to earth and attentive. Our orders came out surprisingly fast, as an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms, we loved it. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan which was very tasty as well, Italian food when cooked properly is very comforting. Also another thing that I really enjoyed and just shows how well the kitchen is run, was that the bread for the table came out very warm . I hate going to a restaurant and they serve you cold bread. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience! Lovely restaurant, nice atmosphere, genuine service, good Italian food and convenient parking.\"b\"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food is great...the ambiance is fantastic... The view is superb... The service is state of the art!!!! If you love Italian and want a place that has a classy...but busy...happening feel try Magganio's!\"b\"We came here with a group of colleagues and clients. The staff managed our fluid numbers well (we had some come and some go) and were not flustered at all.\\nWe had so much food we couldn't do it all - I think it was one of the set menus here basically the food just keeps coming. We had beef medallions, lasagne, salads, pasta, the works, all very tasty, well prepared and served promptly and hot! \\nCan't fault it, have been here several times in Vegas and highly recommend it for a casual meal.\"b\"All I can say is holy moly ravioli! Amazing Italian food, great vibes, great service, beautiful view, and did I say the food was on point? The Four Cheese Ravioli and the  Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo were the best I have ever had. As a local I know their are a lot of Italian restaurants in Las Vegas but nothing beats Maggiano's. Always on the top of my list!\"b\"Been to maggiano's in New Jersey. Better experience there. From the hostess who ignored us and spent time talking to servers while she saw us waiting to the waiter who put in the wrong salad order to the server who brought us our main course before we were finished with the salad the employees were not the best. The food was very good so that is the only thing that kept me from giving 2 stars. Maybe it was a bad night for the workers. ( main courses cooled down while we were finishing our salads in a hurry. Couldn't linger over salads since our food was already on the table. )\"b'Food was nothing special.'b\"Perfect place for a romantic dinner. Food is great and the portion size is also awesome! Did wait about 10 min. for a seat but obviously what do you expect, it's an amazing restaurant! Amazing food as well as amazing host's. The lady who helps us was named Mariana I think and she was so nice and helpful . Coming here again no doubt !\"b\"Great atmosphere. For appetizer we had the zucchini fritte which was my husbands favorite. We also ordered a side of Caesar salad which needed more dressing so we asked for more. We also ordered the tomato basil soup, not the best soup Ive had, it's too watery and not enough of the tomato taste more basil. For our entree we got the chicken Marsala the lighter version and my husband said the chicken was dried. I had the Alfredo fettuccine with chicken. My Alfredo sauce was alright, not my favorite I think Olive Garden has better Alfredo fettuccine. Overall not bad for lunch but for Italian food it was decent price and the waitress was really nice!\"b'This place is just excellent and their food is delicious and the Apple crostada is out of this world. Favorite dish is the rustic chicken n shrimp'b'Went in last night after some friends getting married.  I am giving it 3 stars because the atmosphere is great and our server was wonderful. I have been here a few times and the food was always good. Last night it was lacking something. The presentation was boring it was as if it was just thrown on the plate little messy. Apps were good chopped salad was Delish.  I would say that was my fav of all the dishes we had.  Seems as if quality has gone downhill :('b'Classy, Rat Pack Music, Meticulously Clean, Upscale.\\n\\nMen...wear a suit/tie or dress it down nicely casual, but certainly no flip flips and gym shorts here!  \\n\\nThe dark wood interior walls have some nice old Las Vegas framed black n white photos. Tables are white cloth. Nicely dressed wait staff. Bathrooms even have cloth towels! Just a very classy Italian restaurant!\\n\\nHaving lunch on the outdoor patio overlooking The Strip was wonderful on this beautiful Spring afternoon. \\n\\n*Full bar w/ dining option. \\n**Happy Hour specials. \\n***Reservations recommended for seating by floor to ceiling windows or prepare to go shopping and come back and wait some more, etc.  \\n\\nHere\\'s my favorite, hands down...Rig D!  \\nRigatoni \"D\" $17.95\\nHerb-Roasted Chicken, Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions &amp; Marsala Cream Sauce.\\n\\nAlong w/ my Rig D...I ordered a side salad w/ house dressing, fresh loaf of bread w/ some oil/vinegar and a pat or 2 of butter, washed it down w/ some iced tea w/ lemon wedge and then relaxed with a full stomach enjoying a nice glass of Pinot Grigio Santa Margherita to complete one of my all time favorite meals :)  \\n\\nThis can be a very romantic place or bring your co-workers to celebrate a special occasion, but do leave the kids at home!\\n\\nBuon appetito!'b\"I love this place. The portions are huge. I'd rather have a smaller portion with a salad included.  The bread and olive oil is ok at best. The view of the strip makes it nice.\"b\"Hands down my favorite place in the world. Great location with amazing scenery!\\n\\nI always get the famous d \\n&amp; I will continue to do so. \\n\\nI have certain food allergies that keep me from eating things made in this dish but they're more than happy to make me a new batch without said ingredients. \\n\\n10/10 would recommend to a friend. \\n\\nThanks for existing. \\n\\n(should expand throughout vegas)\"b'Friendly service. and a great view of the Encore, Wynn, and Palazzo! Will definitely return. :)'b'Was super slow tonight . Good good service ok. Got my order wrong at first . Then my take out veggie only salad was tiny at $15 plus 20% tip. Sad'b\"Fantastic franchise that makes you feel like you are part of the familia, Maggiano's has an excellent template of a menu replicated at each location. This particular location is given special attention because it's in Vegas. The view is brilliant from the corner window tables, very romantic. Some days there is a violinist strolling around playing requests. Try the calamari and Maggiano's salad to begin with, stuffed mushrooms aren't bad either. Traditional fare is great, lasagna and angel hair pasta with Arrabiata sauce. Finish with tiramisu and a moscato, delicious.\"b\"Everything was good and very well presented. Service was top notch. All food tasted like I was in Italy and the creme br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e was also good, but when isn't it.  I recommend this place for sure.\"b'Haven\\'t been to a Maggiano\\'s in such a long time. I happened to be doing a little shopping over the weekend, so a friend and I decided to grab a quick bite. \\n\\nThe greeters were super friendly and funny...I always appreciate a little humor. People in the service industry on the strip can get so jaded dealing with tourists. \\n\\nReservations were not needed during off peak hours. We came here around like 2 pm, and we were seated immediately.\\n\\nWe ordered the fried zucchini, ravioli, and Maggiano\\'s salad.\\n\\nHOLY MOTHER OF **** the fried zucchini is amazing. I don\\'t know where they are buying their zucchini, but the pieces were gigantic and barely fit on the serving platter (let\\'s try not to think about GMO\\'s for the moment). And my goodness, the tangy creaming sauce they bring with it...so good! I could\\'ve eaten ONLY this. \\n\\nMaggiano\\'s salad was a spectacular burst of flavor. I normally hate blue cheese, but it was nicely tossed throughout the salad with crispy pieces of prosciutto. The prosciutto was a little overcooked, but that was really my only complaint. \\n\\nOur waiter was prompt, but unfriendly. I don\\'t think I saw a smile the entire time. In fact, he seemed a little annoyed we were lavishing in our \"girly time.\" He could stand to take a couple notes from the greeting staff at the door, they were so nice!'b\"Thank you Maggiano's  for making my Moms Birthday dinner special ! The manager Jesse was friendly , helpful and came to our table personally to make sure we were okay . Our waiter Nick was  professional and knowledgeable about the menu and what to suggest , an absolute delight ! We got the Calamari Fritti , Chicken Parmesan , Veal marsala , Chopped salad with chicken  and the Nonna's pound cake  for dessert !  Dinner was delicious and the service was superb !\"b\"Beautifully decorated restaurant on the second floor of the fashion show mall, across the street from the Wynn. The food was amazing. We had the calamari appetizer and garlic bread. The seafood pasta was loaded clams, shrimp,lobster, and muscles in a rich red sauce. Absolutely delicious. The spaghetti and meatball is also amazing, it comes with a huge, tasty meatball. The portions are big so it's best to come hungry and share an entree. It's obvious that this establishment uses fresh, quality ingredients. Our waiter, Mark, was the absolute best and so on top of everything. Everyone was so nice and I especially loved guy who greeted each table with beautiful songs. This was without a doubt the best place we have eaten during our stay. The atmosphere is classy but without the snobbishness and the view of the strip is also a plus. Best to make a reservation.\"b'We read comments from yelp before going to dinner. I had lasagna which was good. My husband had chicken parmasean with side of spaghetti. His spaghetti was cold and asked for it to be rewarmed. We asked 3 more times and he informed us that he was waiting on the kitchen. After 20 min they showed up with spaghetti. Not impressed at all!'b'We really like this chain. Good quality food, fair pricing, large portions, nice decor and excellent service. The family style is great for large parties, everyone gets to share. We ate here tonight for our anniversary. Our server, Christine, was excellent. We had the chicken parmesana and the tomato basil soup, with a bottle of 14 hands merlot. Everything was delicious! \\nOnly suggestions, please notice water glasses and bread need refilling. Also, a few more options for vegetarians would be appreciated. There are usually more items to choose from when eating Italian food. We always know we will have an enjoyable meal at Maggianos'b'Been to this restaurant twice and it was better the first time. This visit food was good, but not extraordinary. I had lobster carbonera. It was good, but not a true carbonara. Atmosphere is nice and prices are very reasonable. A nice break from getting rammed on the strip. Wine was pricey though. I would go back another time and give another chance.'b\"Food was delicious. I ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo (lighter choice). It was delicious. We also order the 5 mini deserts for I believe $13. Pretty and very good. Best tiramisu I've had. Favorite spot in Vegas.\"b'My initial thought was that this feels like a chain restaurant (without realizing it was).  The young low quality waitstaff, the generic menu and the robotic operationally efficient way the place was run all made me think that.\\n\\nThe couple in front of us requested and was granted a booth.  We then ask for a booth and are told there are no booths available.  We look around and there are tons of booths available both on the outskirts of the floor layout and right in the middle.  We ask if those were reserved and the host says no, there is only one table open and no booths open and he says that is due to lack of waitstaff.  Wtf.  Within minutes of us sitting at a table the next couple is sat at a booth...WTF?!?  This pisses off my buddy who says something negative and storms off to talk to the manager.  A random waitress hears this and ask if there is a problem.  I tell her the issue and her reply is essentially \"We have lots of booths available for you to sit\". Long story short the manager moves us to the booth we figured they would seat us at in the first place.\\n\\nOur waiter at the first table was terrible.  I\\'d expect him at an Applebees in some Podunk town of 15,000 people..not a supposed nice restaurant on the strip.  His unkept hair and facial hair that more closely resembled pubic hair made him look like he was homeless.  He talked like a \"surfer duuuude.\"  This isn\\'t Taco Bell buddy.  He also didn\\'t seem to know what he was doing.  He would just ask if we know what we want and then would disappear for a long time.  He brought my water without the lemons I requested.  When he asked if we needed anything else I said lemons and he\\'s like \"Sure dude\"seemingly oblivious to the fact that he had previously told us he would bring some.\\n\\nOur waiter at our 2nd table was much more experienced.  He gave us spiels about the menu items.  He was also far more attentive.  One funny thing I heard him say quite loudly to the other waiter that most would have taken offense to was that the first waiter \"won the lottery\" which was an obvious reference to us not spending much money.  It should be noted that we ordered drinks/desert later which he didn\\'t realize when he made the comment.\\n\\nTo me the menu was boring and bland.  It should be noted I don\\'t eat seafood.  There was nothing that jumped out at me and told me it wanted me to eat it so I just made the oh so generic order of Spaghetti and Meatballs with meat sauce.  It was tasty.  Don\\'t expect anything special from it.  Free bread before the meal always gets my approval and it was good.  I also ordered the Tiramisu which was awesome.  Definitely recommend that.\\n\\nMy buddy was told each waiter only has 4 tables which I can\\'t fathom especially with as poor service as the original waiter delivered.  I assumed they were having service issues because youtube personality \"The Trooper\" recently quit working there.  The host was clueless and didn\\'t even know who The Trooper was.  Whattttuuuup Trooper, it\\'s the yelp reviewer letting you know that Maggianos has already gone downhill since you left.'b'This place is awesome . Really nice tasty different beers . Had that Marco deal and it was Really nice . Luv that place . Ohh and also nice view if u chose to set outside .'b'Family style Italian Resturant in a nice more up scale yet casual setting. This is a chain Resturant but this location is located in Fashion Show Mall with drive up valet parking available on the side of the building to provide easy access. \\n\\nThe drinks are good and the food is awesome. There are all sorts of Italian favorites and they are done right. A perfect place to take family out on the town for a nice dinner with a view of the stripe or a dinner date prices are fair and great portions of food. I will definatley come back!'b\"The food is so good here I really like the chicken Alfredo, it's the best I ever tasted down here in Vegas, it's probably best to make table reservations because you might have to wait awhile when you walk in, is a nice clean classy Italian joint, with some good food, dessert is good my favorite was the cheese cake.\"b\"Oh no, Maggiano's, what is happening to you?  This used to be a GREAT place to eat, with delicious food, wine, good atmosphere and service.  Sadly, about a year ago when I was in LV and I ate there with my partner the food was just OK and we felt it was overpriced for the quality. I felt the same when I was there again last October.  Still, I have eaten there almost every trip I take to LV so I went again a few days ago. This time, YIKES!  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and I could barely eat it.  I wonder if it was stored in the kitchen for a while or what, because I could only eat a few bites.  It was sitting on top of spaghetti which was (weird and tasted) just OK.  Before my main meal I had tomato bisque soup which was very salty.  I was so disappointed in the meal.  My waiter was rather scattered.  I had to ask him four times for some butter for my bread. I will say he was friendly and did his best.  I think he could tell I did not like the food as he did give me some lemon cookies from their bakery when I asked for my check.  I will say those were delicious, but I wasn't there for cookies.  I don't think I will come back to eat at Maggiano's unless the locals tell me that the restaurant has improved and is back on track. I'm sad to give this review as I really used to love Maggiano's, and that is why it gets two stars instead of one.   :-(\"b'Iliana was our lovely server for a party of 13, and she was fantastic!  Food was great, drinks were perfect, overall great night!'b'Great experience.  Had a party of nine to celebrate a wedding.  The staff was very attentive and helpful.  The food was great.'b\"I give this place four stars, because Maggiano's food quality is losing its touch.  They used to be amazing.  Overall I do like the location.  Theres a great view and its in a fun shopping mall.  The price of the food is expensive, so I do expect good service and food quality each time I go.  If you can tell the difference between good Italian and great Italian then this place might be a hit or miss depending on the chef.  If not, then you will think this place is outstanding.\"b'The service was terrible! It was way over priced for the amount of food you got. The food tasted fine, but for what you pay, you think you would get more. Too pricey.'b\"My experience at Maggiano's:\\n\\n1. Was greeted promptly and with courtesy\\n2. Food server was outstanding\\n3. Management presence was minimal\\n4. Food quality was marginal\\n5. View of the Strip was enjoyable\\n6. Interior was clean and comfortable\\n7. Design and motif was excellent\\n\\nWould likely return, but could probably find better quality Italian food elsewhere.\"b'The food was excellent I ordered the lunch lasagna my wife ordered the lunch chicken Parmesan. When we received our food we were amazed at the lunch portions and the extra side order of spaghetti. The food was amazing. The atmosphere in side is nice but the view from outside is lovely.'b\"This place is absolutely phenomenal. The food is amazing , great quality, great location , positive environment. Staff is every helpful which makes the experience great . Fast &amp; friendly ! I would recommend this place to anyone , great for locals &amp; visitors ! Suits all occasions whether it's a romantic date or a night out with the whole family !! \\nBrandon was our server which is awesome &amp; Christy , the manager was very polite !\\nLove this place !\"b'Went here this evening for my 2nd visit. Although the first visit was a very positive one, a reality check was in line this evening. \\n\\n1. Food server was not welcoming - rude in fact\\n2. Food server was very difficult to understand\\n3. Food server was robotic and seemed to be completely in genuine  (almost cold)\\n4. Asked management to change our server\\n5. Management came to the table and asked \"Why?\" (Um, yes - the Supervisor / MOD actually did this\\n6. Food quality was fair\\n7. New server was pleasant, but a little overly friendly and robotic. \\n8. Likelihood of returning has diminished to 60%.'b\"We avoid the strip area if possible, it's usually crowded and lots of traffic, but when we do make a trip this way, our dinner spot is Maggiano's!\\n\\nEach time we are here, the service is always great, no matter who it is. Managers are looking around, making sure things are in order. Someone is alway coming around to refill drinks, clear empty dishes and our server tonight, Val, is great. She made sure everything went smoothly, kids ordera were put in so they don't have to wait so long and brought out their desserts just at the right time.\\n\\nTheir portions are BIG, I always leave with half my dish to go and when I reheat it the next day, it's still delicious!\"b\"I found them using the TripAdvisor application on my phone and the cool part was that I made a reservation thru the application!   I made the reservation for 6:30pm on a Friday and I drove 15 minutes.   I literally walked in and sat down.  Bypassed a line and they were packed.  I love this application! \\n\\nWHERE TO PARK:  There is complimentary valet parking at Forever 21 on Fashion Show drive.  There is an elevator that takes you to the back of the restaurant. \\n\\nLocated above the Las Vegas Strip it has a great view and ambiance. \\n\\nI ordered a bowl of Creamy Tomato Basil Soup which was devine.  The bread complimented the meal but I was disappointed I wasn't offered Italian dipping sauce (Italian butter by a different name).  I love olive oil, vinegar and spices to dip my bread in.\\n\\nI had a large Grilled Chicken Caprese salad as my entree and asked to substitute spinach for the mixed greens.   Off the menu:  Fresh Mozzarella, Tomatoes, Cucumbers,Kalamata Olives, Red Onions, Garlic Croutons &amp; White Balsamic Vinaigrette. \\nI like that the cucumbers and chicken were diced up, perfect mouthfuls.   I could barely taste the mozzarella cheese even though they were large bites.  I would recommend a stronger cheese that can overcome the dressing and stand out on its own.  The olives were pitted and I really appreciate that.  \\nI topped off the meal with a hot Cappuccino.\\nMy waiter, Rafael E.,  was very attentive,  pleasant and visited me often.  My water glass was never empty and there were no broken dishes.\"b\"Check out the image that I posted for this restaurant! Their food is amazing, the staff is super friendly, and the service was really fast too.\\n\\nIf you like Italian, do not miss out on this restaurant. And a personal turn on for me is when restaurants have (GOOD) olive oil on the table for you, and Maggiano's sure does have amazing olive oil :p \\n\\nThe location of this restaurant is kinda cool too, because it's right above the mall so you can go shopping after eating if you need anything. \\n\\n5 Stars with no doubt\"b'The Las Vegas restaurant scene can be overwhelming and expensive.  My family was in the mood for pasta so after much research, we decided to give Maggiano\\'s a try.  We all had pasta and were  very happy with our meals.  I had the shrimp scampi which was excellent!  One thing we liked was the \" lighter side\" options on some of the pasta dishes, which was perfect for my wife and daughter. The service was excellent and the prices are reasonable.  Give it a try!'b'For a chain establishment the customer service at this location was excellent. We sat at the bar because the dining room was full. We had full service and the bartender Michael was superb. Not to mention his recommendation for the lobster carbonara was fantastic.'b\"My go-to place for pasta in Vegas for now on.  I drove to Vegas right after work from Cali on an empty stomach with a craving for some pasta done right.  I had Maggiano's book marked so it was the obvious choice.  Pulled into Fashion Show Mall garage, and I just happened to park right by an elevator that led directly to Maggiano's... Already winning.  Out the elevator we walked into what looked to be the alternative entrance with a sign that said go to the main host booth up front.  It was a little awkward at first walking all the way through the restaurant to get to the front but it gave us a chance to admire the place....   Loved the atmosphere and decor.\\nFresh bread was good but pretty basic, slight disappointment there as I was kinda expecting something that would blow Olive Garden's breadsticks out the water.  But they did have some legit olive oil on the table.\\nWe ordered the Chefs Special Lobster carbonara and chicken fettuccine.  The lobster carbonara... just might be the best pasta I've had.  Perfectly made creamy cheesy carbonara sauce infused with the flavors both the smoked bacon and the lobster was crazy good.\\nMy wife's fettuccine was a huge disappointment in comparison.  It had an off taste that she nor I did not like.  Fortunately we were able to take it back, I sadly gave my wife my dish and I ordered lasagna, which was super good too, easily one of the best lasagna dishes I had.\\nI was also told they are willing to do custom pasta dishes where you can pick your noddles, sauces, and items in the pasta.\"b'We got a great view, great food and pleasant service. What more could I have asked for.'b\"A bit overpriced in my opinion but good standard Italian comfort food. Ordered a French cab to sip on, a simple spaghetti with marinara sauce, and a side of cooked spinach. What more could a girl need? I came here in the daytime for lunch on the strip so it wasn't too crowded at all. Service was prompt and food did not take ages to come out. Good job!\"b\"I recently dined at this Maggiano's and it was wonderful. I have never had such a great experience dining by myself at the bar with the bartender Stephanie. The food was fresh the calamari was tender the salad was crunchy and crispy and the flavors were delectable. I spoke with one manager briefly I believe his name was Jesse he made sure I was well taken care of and was enjoying myself, another young lady who is a manager and very beautiful also make sure I was well taken care of I want to say her name was Christmas? She had dark reddish brown hair with bangs and she was tall and stunning but very professional if only I could of have the courage to ask her for her phone number. Stephanie is a great bartender and made a wicked delicious sangria it's always good when you can't taste the alcohol in your drink that means it's really good! I will definitely be back and hopefully I'll run into Christmas and Stephanie, those ladies are awesome and easy on the eyes to.\"b'Great Food , Friendly Staff , Big Portions \\nNice Atmosphere I will return and bring more friends and family'b'Try try try the Tuscan Mussels. Never would I have thought I\\'d like \"sea slugs\". But I could not get enough of these!\\nI\\'d give this place 5 stars but for the price, the service was lacking.  Our server didn\\'t get all of our order right and our drinks took forever.'b\"My husband and I had our wedding reception here in March 2015 and we were thrilled with how everything went -- the location, the room, the food, the setup: made our special day so memorable. Everyone on the event/catering staff was a pleasure to work with and made the whole planning process a breeze. The room size and table setup was perfect, and we shipped some items ahead for place-setting decor and they did an amazing job setting everything just like we envisioned. The waitstaff was superb and the food was to die for. I want to go back and repeat. All of our guests raved about the dinner, served family-style just like in the restaurant. If you're looking for a venue for a special occasion/gathering in Las Vegas, I can't recommend Maggiano's highly enough!\"b\"Had lunch here and it was great. The food and service was just womderful. It had a great atmosphere. Will come back next time I'm in towm\"b\"Disappointed! Crab Cakes were not good. Filled with fish and too much breaking. No lump crab meat. Back fin ok but, with $$$, not worth it. Chicken Piccata  had too many capers, sloppy presentation  and no sauce. Worst part is that I made reservations 2 weeks ago for Father's Day and requested a table by the window. They only had a booth right next to the bathroom entrance which did not start the evening off well. Use to be one of my Favorite places on The Strip to dine, but, not anymore.\"b\"Ate here Sunday for lunch with a friend for the first time.. We had a looong night/early morning &amp; wanted some good food after our check out.\\n\\nI ordered the mushroom ravioli.. Which would have been great had it not been so damn salty. I literally was only able to eat 2 pieces of ravioli.\\nI don't remember what my friend ordered but it looked SO good.\\n\\nService was great. No complaints &amp;the location is great.\"b'Quality of the Dish:  5 *stars points\\nService: 4 *\\nInterior: 3*\\nOrganizations: 5*\\nHygiene  : 4* \\n\\nThe price was not overpriced for the portions'b\"My 7 year old didn't care much for alfredo ziti (and she's not a picky eater at all). I tried linguini and clam with white sauce. It was little too salty but it was decent nonetheless with tons of clam. My mom had the shrimp scampi and thought it was decent. Service was excellent.\"b'The flatbread was delicious and the pasta alfredo with chicken and shirmp mmmm, the price was right!!!'b\"This Place Is So Delicious!!!\\nMy sister and her husband had taken me here while I was in Las Vegas for the weekend &amp; let me tell you, I want this place where I live. \\n\\nYes it's pricey, but it's so worth it! The plates are big and will fill you up!\\nThe staff is lovely and had no problem what so ever with that. \\nI recommend this place if you want to have a very nice dinner. This will definitely be a place that I will make a priority to eat at while I'm down here again.\"b\"They mailed my mom a birthday coupon, so we went as a family, baby and all. The wait was long and it was hot, but we opted to sit in the outdoor seating area to avoid waiting (underneath the escalator, without misting system as it was out). The view across the Strip looking at Wynn's lush landscaping was kinda nice. The ads playing on loop on the Wynn billboard also kept me entertained. There were a couple of memorable ambulance runs down the Strip, as I felt compelled to to pressed my hands to the baby's ears to protect her eardrums. \\n\\nNot much to say about the food, it's Maggiano's. I remember liking the one in Houston better but I think it depends on what you get and I was not particularly impressed with the dishes we got that night. I think next time they mail in a coupon, I'll pass.\"b'One of my favorite restaurants in las vegas! Their balcony is the best place to eat and its always nice going to a restaurant connected to fashion show mall since its close by after shopping. My favorite thing on their menu is their seafood linguine! Their chocolate cake and latte is really good as well.'b\"I came to Maggiano's celebrate another yelper Terri R birthday with family and friends. It was my first visit so never had much came to expectations. Truthfully left with nothing exciting or inspiring comes to review. If there was one thing that stood out more then the food was the service was awesome. Our waitresses really wish remember her name cause she deserve shout out in otherwise A-OK review. She was super friendly, cracking jokes with everyone keeping the atmosphere positive/festive, on top of our every needs, and personnel touches stood out for me. She had whole separate dessert just for birthday girl. Just happen she was not at the table so took the dessert back and waited for birthday girl come back light the table right in front of her. Great service.\\n\\nSince it was decent size party we had nine. Terri was able to order family style meal. It reminded me Bucca di Beppo style. Starters we had fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and caesar salad. Entrees not sure the filling believe ricotta raviolis with tomato sauce, spaghetti with tomato sauce, chicken marsala think, and lasagna. Dessert chocolate cake, and one more forgot. By the time got to the dessert was stuffed. None of the dishes had WoW factor at ALL. Some of them felt like lack any depth of flavor. The tomato sauce in the spaghetti and am sure same base sauce use on the lasagna. Bland not even sure if they put salt or pepper in it. The portion size got nothing to say except nice and generous. The pricing not all that bad for strip restaurant. The atmosphere is upscale but looking at the prices reasonable. It located in the Fashion Show Mall so parking is ample and whether you valet or not easy access. \\n\\nOverall so many more italian restaurant in Vegas that are just as reasonable that food taste so much better. On this night it celebration BeastMode Terri R. not about the food but supporting family. Happy Birthday Terri R.!!!!\"b\"Best meal in Vegas!  Beverly our server was outstanding, and the food was delicious.  Maggiano's is a 10/10. The lasagne was to die for... Go during happy hour for dome great prices on Coppola wine too!\"b\"Again, this place will get five stars from me.  I'm just going to keep this one simple.  Great food, great service, and a spectacular view overlooking the Las Vegas strip.  We had dinner here a few weeks ago and despite the hustle and bustle inside, the atmosphere was great.  They even have a singing maitre d.  Overall, we had an amazing time and went home with full and happy belly's.\"b\"Dined here on 7/10... 3 stars because the food was so delicious. The service however, was substandard. The waiter wasn't very friendly, rushed us into ordering, forgot to bring our drinks as well. Not sure if will dine here again, as this wasn't the first Maggiano location who didn't provide good service, which is unfortunate.\"b\"The bread is always warm and fresh. The balsamic on the table is just enough balsamic to make your taste buds giggle when dipped in a mixture of olive oil with the bread,then transform into delicious savory hug as it cascades down your throat. All the Italian food from the salad (my favorite) to the pasta tastes authentic and flavorful. The atmosphere is inviting, homey yet elegant and everyone who I've have the pleasure of being served by has been polite and personable. It's awesome. GO.\"b'Been here twice and the food is always tasty. My mushroom ravioli was delicious and my mom had their chicken fettuccine Alfredo and it was mediocre. One thing I did love was this fruity soda they had. Very fresh and tasty. Our server was okay, she looked like she was in a rush the whole time. Either than that everything was fine. We had a really good table next to the windows so I loved that.'b'I absolutely loved this restaurant! We arrived with a group of 9, including two small children, and they were able to accommodate room for our strollers. The wait was not long l, considering that it was noon and the lunch rush had just started. Their kids menu was reasonable and delicious!'b'Good atmosphere and good food all around but the stuffed mushrooms are my favorite out of any restaurant. I will go just so I can order them as an appetizer.'b'We had a great experience for our reception dinner.  We only had a small group (13 people) but I think even if we would have had 100 more people the experience would have been the same.  I was able to book everything online via email through Beth.  Beth was fabulous every step of the way, she answered my emails very quickly, always responded to my \"just one more thing\" and took a few moments to show me around when I arrived in town before our event.  When we arrived everything was set up and ready to go, we were able to step outside for less than 10 minutes, review our bill and pay it so we could just enjoy our evening. The flow of the evening went smoothly, the food was incredible, my guests are still talking about it and Joe kept our glasses filled.  My only complaint was that I didnt get to try the chicken dish that I heard was so delicious but that was my own fault (and Joes for being so efficient in filling my wine glass)!  \\n \\nWhen we were ready to leave our leftovers were boxed up and ready to go which was great for our guests and ultimately us too as our flight was cancelled and it made for a great breakfast even though there was no chicken left over!  If you need a place to host an event this is the place to go everything was wonderful from start to finish, thanks again!'b'Insist want to thank to all the staff! They made my wedding reception incredibly beautiful, it was only for 4 hours but we all enjoyed the  food, the service and desserts! \\nEverything was delicious!! Me and my husband are very happy. We made a great decision of making our wedding reception here.'b\"Best Italian restaurant I've been to in Vegas in the strip!\\n\\nLobster Carbonara was uniquely the best italian I've had as far!\"b\"Lobster carbonara and hand twisted noodles ...all from a 'scratch kitchen'...this place is excellent! Happy hour is from 3-6pm ... great atmosphere and employees!\"b'Great strip views with perfectly prepared Italian food. I highly recommend the Lobster Carbonara and stuffed mushrooms. Very reasonably priced for the setting, vibe, and quality of food. I like the lobster carbonara here. Rich, decadent, and filling.'b'As expected EXCELLENCE in front and service by Stephanie. Very similar service as in Costa Mesa. \\nMama, ask for the \"Today and Tomorrow Treat\" but we did not. It was already included with our MARCO\\'S MENU special for $40 for two, appetizer, lasagna, Tiramisu and two pasta meals for tomorrow!\\nWhat a GREAT DEAL.\\n\\nGracie Marco - Arrivederci Stefania'b'Best Italian Meal Ever!!!  We ordered the Famous Rigatoni D, Lobster Carbonara, Bruschetta, salad and  creamy tomato basil soup.  Even the salad dressings were yummy.  Great service and pretty view of the Wynn and the Encore  hotels.  Looking forward to trying them at home in SoCal.  We had to come to Vegas to try them out.'b'I love maggianos. The sausage and peppers are really good. The peppers are so good plus the peppers are so colorful and sweet. The food is really good. Plus the device is good and the waiters are nice. I have sat inside and outside and i actually prefer sitting outside.'b\"I booked the reservations for party of 7 at 8.30 PM on Saturday (8/1). We were 2 families and one of the family was running late. One family party of 4 (2 Adults, 1 kid 7 yrs and 1 (2 yrs old)) arrived at 8.32 PM. They went to the host and asked for the reservation which was under his name (me). The hostess was reluctant to have them seated after requesting 2-3 times stating that they will make everyone seated once all the parties will arrive. What kind of customer service is this? Finally getting impatient as 2 yrs old was cranky i had raise my voice and asked for the manager. Then finally at 8.50 PM they got us seated - my friends family arrived 5 mins later. This in appropriate for a business like Maggiano's - the host should have been trained on the behavior on how to interact with the customer. I wouldn't recommend Maggiano's Las Vegas due to its poor customer service in dealing with people specially families with Kids. Thereafter the service was phenomenal - waitress were nice - Food was great too. But initial experience was pathetic.....\"b'Delicious lasagna. My husband and I ordered two chopped salads and one lasagna and it wAs plenty of food. Salads, bread, and lasagna were delicious.'b\"This place was great!  Great food, cocktails, ambience, and view of all the city lights at night.  It's located on the 2nd floor of the Fashion mall across from Trump Towers.  I had one of their specials that was basically a chicken dish of chicken kabob-type pieces with chicken meatballs and chopped peppers, onions, and quartered potatoes. The hubs had chicken Parmesan that came with a side of spaghetti.  Everything is a la carte so we also ordered dinner salads.  Great Mojitos &amp; vodka martinis. The buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah-mazing.  We rolled out of their we were so full.  The place was hopping even at 8:30 pm.\"b\"It was such an amazing meal for me and my friends, they only reason I give it 4 stars is because we where seated in such a small table... Our plates didn't really fit . otherwise food was amazing\"b\"Always been a fan of Maggiano's, but this location is my favorite so far. We had a very nice strip view, the service was great and the food was delicious as always. The fried zucchini appetizer is a must try.\"b'Atmosphere and staff are great. Price for the quality and quantity of food is good. We had a group of 18 and did the family dinner plan, a great deal especially if everyone is starving. The food and drinks keep coming without asking until you beg them to stop. Taking into account we were eating dinner at 10 pm and they were closing I will say that they did a great job and didnt rush us. We will return again at a regular dinner hour and see if the food is any better.'b'Crab cakes were out of this world.  Perfectly cooked and presented with a small salad, just the perfect amount of food for a lunch or early dinner.  The Lemon Drop cocktails were equally delicious.  Service--A+'b'Love their hot bread and vinegar to start with! Lobster carbonara was the best! Stuffed mushrooms were to die for!!'b'I\\'m a regular guest, and I\\'m very disappointed with the new \"photography\" service that this restaurant offers. The girl that barely spoke English, insisted on taking a picture while I was eating!!! Moreover, in approximately five minutes a young man, who did not have a proper uniform for this upscale place, came over with a printed pictures and pushed me to buy one. I can\\'t believe this restaurant went down so low to allow soliciting. I simply won\\'t be back.'b\"Im actually sitting in the restaurant right now and I have to write this review ASAP Bc just ugh.\\n\\n\\nI'm basing my review on the food. Our waiter was very good but the food was not up to par.\\n\\nFirst off the bread they serve is par baked. So it's not fully crunchy or done. Bleh.\\n\\nI ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and I had super high expectations Bc it's an Italian place and they're known for cheese. They dip was 75% thinned cream and 25% spinach and artichoke! I don't know if the chef just ran out of ingredients but I am so not paying $15 for something so crappy! View picture for my struggle. The crostini was fine it could be sliced thin get but the dip was just HORRIBLE! They didn't make a thick enough rox or didn't add enough cheese to make the dip thick and they didn't put enough spinach and artichoke! How could the expediter allow this to happen? SMH I'm better off buying a FROZEN pack from Trader Joes!\"b\"We were really surprise by how busy this restaurant at the mall was, we arrived hungry and ready to eat at 6pm thinking that we would get seated right away but it was packed!  30 minute wait which is not too bad.  \\n\\nThe food was delicious, the linguine frutti de mares was excellent, extra large portion with extra mussels, clams, lobster, and a kick of spices, which is appetizing for a hot summer night.  I wanted a lighter fare so I ordered the caprese mozzarella and the cheese was so good.  I did order grilled scallops for my main course, but I think it was sitting under the lights for too long and the scallops were overcooked...to the point of being stringy and hard.  The manager took the order away and offered to replace the scallops for another dish on the house.  At that point we were full from the pasta dish so we declined.  I think it was just an oversight on such a busy night.  Beside this incident, we really enjoyed our meal at Maggiano, service was excellent, food was delicious, ambiance was authentic and on point.  If you're craving for some real authentic italian food, this place is a great option.\"b\"Came here for my husband's birthday. First time here, our server was real nice and explained well the menu. The food was great and my husband loved the bread (he kept asking for more) :) \\n\\nThere was also this gentleman providing entertainment and he sang happy birthday to my husband. \\n\\nIt was a lovely evening.\"b\"Amazing !!!!! I took my boyfriend here for his 30th birthday and omg we were blown away ! The food was amazing ! We had the Bruschetta, Rigatoni D, and Chicken Parmesan ! After we ate a wonderful man came and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend with his guitar. Then the restaurant manager came over and asked how our night was going then insisted that we have dessert in honor of his birthday . I didn't the name of the three desserts we were given complimentary btw but it was amazing !!!!! Will defiantly be returning !\"b\"One of the best experiences I've had in Vegas in a long time! My husband and I were born and raised in Vegas. We are always looking for new delicious places to eat! When we were kids we would hang out at the Fashion Show mall a lot but Maggianos was a little bit out of our price range. You definitely get what you pay for. Large portions, great service and amazing desserts!!! We had the most delicious creme br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e I've ever had! The tiramisu was also delish!! The only complaint I had was the bread . It is very traditional oil and balsamic dipping bread but my husband always prefers garlic bread. Just preference. I love bread either way! :))) I would highly recommend this place!!\"b\"First time trying out this Italian restaurant! They had awesome service and started off with warm bread and olive oil and balsamic. They weren't stingy with how many pieces of bread they gave us! I had the seafood pasta and asked for no mussels or clams and they stuffed it with more shrimp and lobster. They aren't stingy with their portions!\"b\"I would give 10 stars if I could. Even better Raphael was one best waiters I've had in years. He almost told me ingredients he was so precise. Top notch food. Thank you guys for the experience on my annerversary. Food was amazing of course!!\"b\"I've always had great experiences here. Food is always great and very reasonably priced. The two of us had dinner with a glass of wine each,  and the tab came out to about $80. Not bad! \\n\\nI had the chicken marsala and absolutely loved it. The mushrooms were amazing. Paired it with a Zinfandel from Cline winery, and it supplemented extremely well. She had the lasagna and seemed to enjoy it as well, and the bread is amazing! I look forward to many more dinners here!\"b'Vanessa was an amazing server! She picked up the slack from our original server who was very busy with a large party of people. So, it was completely understandable. She made me and my friend feel very comfortable had great suggestions and was Fantastic! I had their beef tenderloin and it was deeeelicious! Also, great great tiramisu!'b'We were looking for a good, but not exorbitantly priced Italian dinner on the strip after the Cirque du Soleil show at Treasure Island and Maggiano\\'s (open until 11) did not disappoint.  The food was excellent, the quantities generous, the atmosphere upscale but not formal, and the service both courteous and efficient.  The three of us were uniformly pleased with our respective selections: chicken, spinach and ricotta stuffed manicotti for me, eggplant parmesan with gluten free pasta for Norm, and I believe \"traditional home-style lasagna for Dennis, a favorite of the Philly native.\\n \\nOur meals were preceded by warm, soft and delicious house-baked bread accompanied with olive oil, which we determined not to over indulge in in anticipation of the main dishes of reportedly large portions, which again, did not disappoint in either quality or quantity. \\n\\nMy manicotti rested in on a pool of delicious and thankfully not nauseatingly rich Asiago cream sauce, a 4-Lactaid event of potential dairy disaster, especially as it was determined early on there would be no leftovers, but all settled just fine and I don\\'t regret one rich delicious bite or spooning up the remaining Asiago sauce after the entr\\xc3\\xa9e was gone.  My meal came in at a very reasonable (especially for  the Strip) $18.50 plus $6.50 spinach side salad with pine nuts, a not-overpowering smattering of red onion, applewood smoked bacon, a white balsamic vinaigrette, and blue cheese,  I loathe bleu cheese but had mistaken it on sight for feta, and the salad did not suffer for its removal. Regrettably there was no room for dessert. \\n\\nService was polite, efficient, and more than reasonably attentive.  My iced tea and water glasses never stayed low for long.  Our total for 3, including wine, beer, and my tea and side salad came in at I believe under $100, which we agreed was very reasonable given the location, quality, quantity, service, atmosphere and ambiance.  \\n\\nWe were surprised to learn this restaurant is part of a modest sized chain of Maggiano\\'s Little Italy restaurants, and grateful to find out they have one comparatively near us in Phoenix, over in Scottsdale.  Given distances (and our budgets!), Maggiano\\'s won\\'t be a regular dining destination for us, but it will be a special one.  If all locations are as good as this one, we collectively highly recommend.'b\"This a nice spot in the shopping centre away from the casino cacophony. It is a bit of an adventure getting there due to construction along the strip and around the mall. Despite this minor inconvenience, we were welcomed by the bartender and directed to a 4-top table.\\n\\nWaters and cocktails were ordered to battle the slight hangover from previous eve's shenanigans.\\n\\nThe menu is varied but not overdone offering traditional Italian meals. The 4 of us places our orders. I went for the chicken parm sandwich. All our food arrived at once, hot and fresh.\\n\\nMy sandwich was good - nicely seasoned! My dining companions commented similarly regarding their meals.\\n\\nMaggianos opens on to the mall for post-meal shopping and to walk off a good meal!\"b\"Hostess was completely rude about my lace dress, I understand policies, but there is much nicer ways to saying my lace dress want appropriate. No apologies were offered and she completely tried to embarrass me. I'm sure someone could've handled my situation way better than she did. I love coming here but until this hostess is gone I will not be coming back ever.\"b\"Delicious Italian food in the Fashion Show Mall on the strip. Nice setting and great service. A word of warning: the portion sizes are drastically different between entrees. Check with your server what size the entree you want is, I ended up with a massive portion and my husband's dish was tiny. \\n\\nLinguini di mare is delicious, huge, and FULL of seafood! Shrimp fra diavolo is good but small.\"b\"The service was more than expected everyone was fantastic the food was great very filling the location was beautiful the restaurant was very nice our server Paolo was so helpful and friendly we even had a guitarist serenade us it was the best experience I will make it a point to go every time I'm  in town\"b\"Had a great dinner there while celebrating husband's birthday. In fact we were so pleased, we returned there again a day later;). The service was superb, truly the best service we encountered anywhere in a long while. Loved the setting, the atmosphere and the food. I do have one complaint: during the dinner there was a young lady walking around with the camera, offering to take couples photo. At first my husband declined, as he felt he was underdressed, but she insisted that the photo was complimentary, and lingered around until we agreed. She returned toward the end of our dinner with a complimentary postcard as well as two large photos she wanted us to purchase for $40. When we declined, she went down in price and seemed offended we did not want to buy them, when we did not want ANY pictures to begin with. This really should not be taking place during dinner as it is in bad taste and cheapens the whole experience.\"b\"I go here every. single. time. I visited Las Vegas for my tiramisu craving. Even though I've lost my craving for sweets these days, I still come here for that heaping slice.\\n\\nI usually go get it at their to go counter in the back, and they have seats. Sure, the wait time is a little long and sometimes, I have to ask around for a to go person. And I'm not gonna lie, the first time I got lost, but overall, I know where to go now. Seeing how I'm moving back to Las Vegas, I'm going to try to abstain going here as much just so I don't get fat!\\n\\nThe slice itself in to go always seems to make me happy that I get it. They put the slice on chocolate sauce and it seems to be garnished so nicely. Though, I think I'm only going to order at the to go counter, seeing that the last time I order it at the bar, they kind of just got the slice and didn't really do much with it. Still tasted great, but I actually do enjoy how they garnish it.\\n\\nPutting all of that aside. The restaurant and its food is just as splendid altogether. I've eaten there with a friend and they give a great size in portions. Don't remember what I ordered, but then again, it's pasta~! I felt full and happy afterwards!\\n\\nI like it here. I hope it stays for a very long time, despite renovations at the mall! Thanks guys~\"b'We loved everything we got! Amazing drunken noodles, cashew chicken, and the Tom Ka Gai. Artsy, beautiful restaurant too.'b'Family style is the way to go here, great deal, lots of good food and the service was great. The chocolate cake is super rich and the cheesecake is lighter then most which was a nice finisher. The best dish was the lagasana and for appatizer the calamari was worth ordering again. I would stick to the pasta entries or the shrimp preferably.'b\"Impressive impressive... This is rock solid Italian comfort food for sure.  Couples night out and we opted for the family style menu options, for a party of four you can pick three starters, four main dishes and two desserts.  We selected the mozzarella, calamari and Italian tossed salad, all three items were great and plentiful.  The fried mozzarella was my favorite one but the salad and dressing were just as good.  For entrees we ordered all pasta items with the standouts being the lasagna and manicotti dishes.  For dessert we tried the chocolate cake and cheesecake.  I'm not a chocolate person so I didn't try it but the cheesecake was Devine.  We actually ended up with two pieces to match the size of the chocolate cake.  Portions are huge enough for 5-6 really.  The bread was also really yummy with balsamic and oil.  I think this will be a regular stop on future Vegas trips this was a great dining experience!\"b'The food here is very good here, however I left a prior bad review, but upon my second visit and explaining what my issue was, I taken cared of as if I were a princess.'b\"This place doesn't even deserve the one star. First we weren't given menus or water until we had been seated at the hightop in the bar area for 20 minutes. The waitress was terrible. She had zero customer service skills. She never asked us if our food was good, if we wanted refills on water, or even dessert. Overall I found service to be very sub par throughout Vegas. Everyone that works in the hospitality industry there gives off this air of entitlement. Anyways, she got what she deserved, 10%. There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas to get GOOD food and bad service. Skip this one.\"b'We made a reservation here and they had no problem seating us when we arrived 2 hours earlier. The staff was very friendly and waitress provided great service. The food came out quickly and we surprised with the large portions. Everything tasted really great too! Highly recommend!'b'This place was amazing from finish to end. Service is great and plates are worth the price. Good for sharing. Only bad thing I can say is that the tables were really close to each other.'b'Really disappointing..went here with my wife for a \"date night\" out..first our hostess..a business\\'s first impression..was too busy reading a book to pay attention to anything going on around her..including guests waiting..but she did at least put the book inside one of your wine lists to try and make it look like she had been studying that..hmmm..need to work on being conspicuous..next..we were sat and about 5 minutes later were greeted..I think his name was Dave..very \"blah\" attitude and so quiet when talking that we could not hear anything he was saying..and very very slow service..we had ordered our drinks (peach ice tea and raspberry lemonade) which tasted like pure syrup. We ordered the tomato soup, a Caesar salad, and the bruschetta of which he recommended which had bacon, ricotta, and arugula..this was pretty good. The bread that we got..your \"complementary bread\" he had dropped off at table with olive oil..we had wanted balsamic but could not find our server and couldn\\'t get hostess attention (too busy with her book)..tomato soup tastes out of a can and was watery..with one salad crouton in..really?..it took the server a good 10-15 minutes just to come back to get our entree order..we ordered the chicken and shrimp baked pasta and a carbonara for my wife..the carbonara came out..had good flavor, but sauce was really thin and plate set up was on a 15 inch oval..very poor presentation..looked like a sample amount..mine had zero sauce and was bland..chicken tastes like it was boiled in a pot..we were never checked back on to see how things were..defiantly was a strike out for this restaurant..we have never dined here before, but was told in the past that food was good...food, service, and hospitality was not worth the $70 meal.'b\"We were looking for Italian, and this place was easy walking distance from the Trump International, so we gave it a shot.\\n\\nThe decor is nice; they managed to make this place look older than it is. The staff seemed well-prepared and efficient, but this place really gets packed. I recommend making a reservation, otherwise you may wait 30 minutes or more.\\n\\nThe only thing that was a bit off was that they had a live guitarist/singer walking around the tables. He was a nice guy, but he made us a bit uncomfortable not knowing if we were supposed to tip.\\n\\nWe enjoyed our meal and the price was reasonable. If this place were in Hawaii, I'd go back for sure.\"b'Amazing food. The Bacon Brushetta appetizer was to die for. Amazing service by our waitress Nicole. Cannot recommend this place highly enough.'b\"Food was yummy as always.... Love the chopped salad!!!!  Then gotta get mushroom ravioli. It was delicious. Save room for the chocolate cake because it is to die for yummy. I've tried to recreate it but can't get it right.   \\n\\n\\nOur service wasn't the greatest but it was still decent. \\n\\nThus meal was one of the better meals we had this weekend plans s it was cheaper than a few carry out type meals.... Crazy!!!!\"b\"Quick tips for my Yelp friends, ask for the today and tomorrow special and you will receive an entree for today and one to go which is awesome. I've always liked the food here big portions reasonable price you're looking for a place to take your family and have a good Italian food Maggiano's just the place to be so I give this place 5 stars because that's what they are in my book.\"b\"VERY DISAPPOINTED! \\nWent there to try to have Lunch but Hostess turned down a simple request to seat next to the window because the section is Closed according to her. Sat down and no one even approach us to offer drinks or let us know that someone's going to be with us when there was two women right in front of us doing nothing but Chatting to each other. Waitress finally arrived and was having an issue about being rushed to attend to us when she's not even clocked in! Brought the issue to the manager and he was nice enough to give it an effort to correct the Bad experience that we had! He even said we can seat us at the Closed station and he will send a different server to us but we're already on our way out of the place.\\nHope they will not say No! To their guest and try to satisfy them no matter what!\\nWe are locals and  Generous tippers! We could have been regulars if we only got treated Good by the Lunch Staff. Very Sad!\"b\"I was walking the length of the strip and that's a long way! I sort of scoped out all the lunch places, and besides fast food at a mall, this seemed like the most affordable lunch spot that might be nice. I didn't need to spend $70 on lunch at some place that was trying to make me think I was in Paris or something. \\n\\nMaggiano's is located at the edge of the Fashion Show Mall. We arrived for a late lunch and got a nice seat by the windows. This is more or less a sort of upscale place, not a grab lunch and go kinda place. Our server seemed quite professional ... but then the up selling began. Just say no and keep with what you want! The wine pours come in 2 sizes, 6 and 8 oz. Wine prices are not that cheap here though. The food was quite varied on the menu. One of the great deals I spotted was the soup and half sandwich for $9.95. I selected the Cesar Salad and Chicken Parmesan half sandwich. My BF had the Cesar Salad and the Italian Grilled Cheese &amp; Ham. The server brought over bread while we waited.which was scrumptious dipped in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\\n\\n When our food arrived, I was surprised by the portions, nice and big! The salad was a decent size and the sandwich was more than enough to eat. I was expecting a real half of a sandwich from a bread loaf cut into a little triangle ...like mom used to make you! It was served on a nice Italian roll and was very good indeed. I'll say this is one of the better deals in Vegas on the strip. Although with the wine, tax and tip, we still ended up with a near $50 lunch for 2! Oh, well, skip the wine next time! I will say though, this so far is one of my fave places I've eaten at here in Vegas so far. The food is very good here, and not just a slop job cause it tourists.\"b\"We went yesterday for my sisters birthday and we ordered from the lunch family style menu which is basically buffet style.  \\n\\nThe last time we were here were a few years ago and it seems like they changed up the menu because we were able to chose more dishes before and now we are limited to 1-2 items per category.  \\n\\nSo you get to chose 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 pastas and 2 desserts for $23 per person (it use to be 2 for each I believe - my aunt was really disappointed).\\n\\nThey come out with the first plate and if you want more, you order 2nd or 3rd's according to how many people want extra.  (They do allow for you to take things home but they've become quite strict on finishing the first plate first).  \\n\\nThey do have gluten-free penne pasta so I was able to eat that.  \\n\\nWe ordered the caesar salad, calamari, clams and linguine, gluten free baked ziti, tiramisu, and the double fudge brownie.\\n\\nThe salad was a huge let down - the lettuce was super soggy.\\nThe calamari was awesome, light batter and fried to perfection.\\nEveryone who had the clams said the first dish was too salty and the second dish that came out was way better.\\nThe baked ziti had sausage in it and I usually love sausage but I didn't care for theres.  \\nThe tiramisu was delicious and the brownie dish came with ice cream and strawberries.  My nephew and I had the strawberries while everyone else ate the super chocolatey brownie.\\n\\nIt was nice to get together with family and eat a buffet without having to get up.  Our server was nice but could have came around just a tab bit more.\"b\"4 of us met up for a double date lunch and had a fabulous waitor named Robert,  he was very friendly and shared our interests of traveling stories.  It was my first time at this location, our meals were delcious and temperatures were perfect when delivered to the table. Portion sizes were appropriate as well. I look forward to trying another Maggiano's soon! Thank for a great experience.\"b\"Maggiano's is the place that if my friends and I want to treat ourselves to some high quality Italian food, we make a reservation. \\n\\nWe always do Family Style which is where it's at, but you have to have a party of 4 or more. So we get a good size group, pay the $35 a person, then eat until we get our money's worth, and can hardly get out of our chairs.\\n\\nWith family style the order includes a salad, 2 appetizers, 4 entree's, and 2 desserts. \\n\\n**HERE ARE THE MUST GETS**\\nSalad- Caesar Salad.\\nApps- Calamari, Fried Mozzarella.\\nTrey trey's- Chicky Chicky parm parm, mushroom ravioli's, fettuccini Alfredo.\\nZerts- New York Cheesecake, Creme Br\\xc3\\xbbl\\xc3\\xa9e. \\n\\nIn the past, my experience with the waiters and waitresses has been nice with them continuing to bring out food when asked for more with it being all you can eat Family Style and all. \\nI had friends in town for Thanksgiving break who had never been to Las Vegas so I called and made a reservation for us. There was 6 of us at the table and our waitress Vanessa was really stingy and cheap with the amount of food she brought out for us. She took forever to bring out the food when we asked for more and would try and talk us out of being hungry.\\n\\nI love Maggiano's, but next time I go I will make sure Vanessa is not my waitress.\"b\"We love coming here its one of our favorite places. Our waiter really knew his stuff. My wife has a gluten-free diet and it's hard to go anywhere, but our waiter assured us we were in the right place and shared the gluten-free options. My wife had a great meal and mine was delicious as well we're very happy\"b\"Good food to share family style.  Nice private room for 14 people with a nice view.  Better than your normal Italy style chain restaurant, but would've have given a better rating if the courses came quicker between the apps and the main course.  Overall, really good dining experience.\"b'The Food Here was Amazing and the Customer Service Was equally Amazing! 5 Stars all the Way!'b\"Incredible flavors, incredible atmosphere and incredible service await you where Italian cuisine is done just right. From the starter bread to your meal, everything is prepared and presented at this location with tantalizing beauty.\\n\\nMy baked ziti was warm, flavorful and perfectly cheesy. Tasted just great without sausage. :) Mom's spaghetti was just as phenomenal, with rich marinara and basil. So even if you play it safe and stick with spaghetti, you'll still have an unforgettable experience.\\n\\nOur host Kevin was down-to-earth and engaging. And we went in an hour and a half before closing. With a great view of the Fashion Show mall and the Wynn to top it all off. :) Bartender was just as spectacular. \\n\\nA little pricey (plates start at about $15), but well worth it as it tastes better than Buca and Olive Garden combined. Portions are hefty too. If its within your budget, give this Maggiano's a try!\"b'This is one of the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.  I have never had bad food here.  I would highly recommend this place if you live Italian food.'b\"Service was good , bread good , view excellent . Had chicken Marsala and it was tough. It's not that hard to cook chicken , kinda disappointed. Had been excited to go and I probably won't go back . Better local Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas valley .\",)</th>\n",

The drive thru can be a bit slow at times, but they always cook their hash browns to the perfect crisp.'b\"I walked in for a coffee today. I was looking a little more scrubby than normal and figured that the normal patrons and staff of McDonalds might be a little more understanding than a coffee house. I ordered a single iced coffee, paid, and waited at a table opposite the registers. At the time I was the only one there, but shortly after about 10 people got in line. I waited. And waited. And waited. No coffee? I thought that maybe they'd just needed to get their drive customers out of the way before moving on to my ticket. But people after me started receiving their food. 15 minuted after ordering a SINGLE COFFEE I waited through line and handed my receipt to the cashier. She said they must have skipped me and went to give the ladies my ticket by hand. Another 5 minutes later I had my coffee and was on my way. Sorry, McDonalds, I am not interested in waiting 20 minutes for a coffee.\"b'As far as mcdonalds go, this one is one of the better ones. I come here a lot - 27 check ins so far! Ive never had bad service here that i can recall. The management must be doing something right! Kudos to you guys! Plus the kids LOVE the indoor play area here. Its big, accessible, and closed off so my kids arent as tempted to run off. And it has its own bathroom, WITH a changing table - hard to find in vegas. They also occasionally have special events, like ronald mcdonald visiting. 5 stars.'b'If you patron this place you are guaranteed to have your order made incorrectly. Customer service is not an option here folks. One of there off duty employees was in the drive through behind me driving recklessly almost hitting my vehicle every time we had to inch forward. I have spoken to the store manager on multiple occasions, he has tried his best to make things right. However this store needs new staff across the board, the managers on duty are jokes and are not aware of food health and safety guidelines. I personally have called them on violations and have witnessed operational changes. Every time I patron this place I am either missing food or food made incorrectly, when I bring it to the managers attention I am faced with the most rude reaction \" I guess we are just human.\" The only reason I come back is because it is really close to my house. I hope this complaint is viewed by someone that matters because it is straight to corporate next time.\\n\\nBY THE WAY THEY HAVE THIS TACKY SIGN THAT SAYS PAYING CUSTOMERS ONLY HAVE 30 MINUTES TO EAT AFTER THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERED LOITERING AND WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE, MANAGER MUST ENFORCE THIS POLICY(HOW ABOUT ENFORCING CUSTOMER SERVICE)\\nOBVIOUSLY THOSE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE BY EMPLOYEES OF THIS LOCATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'b\"I pretty much only come here to treat my son.  So I took my son here because he loves to play in the kids playground area which is pretty neat for youngsters.  The food just isn't what I used to think when I was younger.  The fries are generally pretty good, unless you get served some cold fries which is disgusting.  I had the double quarter w/cheese + bacon.  It was pretty good, but the burgers are not served HOT like many other fast food places.  I would like to see the cheese melted to my bun from the heat.  Service was pretty much exactly what I would expect, nothing too great, but nothing to complain about either.\"b'Wow. I cant believe that I haven\\'t written a review for this place.\\n\\nIt\\'s almost always busy. Morning, afternoon,night, there\\'s cars in the drive thru.\\n\\nThe staff is always kind. Most fast food places looks like everyone who works there hates their lives.\\n\\n Sometimes the guys on the late shift dance around for you.... Real positive energy! My order has never been wrong, or incomplete here, either.\\n\\nIf the food isn\\'t \"classy\" or \"healthy\" enough for you, don\\'t eat here. I like shopping organic, and what not, but anything in little doses will not hurt you.'b\"It was the longest wait on drive through...  It was more than 20 min..  I don't know what was happened, but they could find some kind of solution, we just got to stuck...\"b'If I could post zero stars I would. Sat in the drive-thru for 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my order and acknowledge someone was waiting. I honked my horn only for the female walking by to ignore. Finally the gentleman from the cash register came over to the window and asked what\\'s wrong...I explained no one was taking orders at the previous two windows and I watched the young girl walk past the window at least 4 times. His reply was \"she saw you but she said she\\'s not working the window today!\" Are you serious? It\\'s called customer service and team work! Evidently no one was working the window. They had a line of 3 cars behind me waiting at the previous window. I didn\\'t even want to eat there after this episode so I politely called McDonald\\'s hotline and drove to Carl\\'s Jr! The worse service I\\'ve ever experienced at a McDonald\\'s. Probably a sign that I need to stop eating there!'b'There was no one line around 3:30am and bought hotcakes, sausage mcmuffin with egg, hashbrown, mcnuggets and a mcdouble. Everything was stale, my mcmuffin wasn\\'t even warm, the cheese was hard and cold, the hotcakes were overcooked and rubbery, mcnuggets hard and rubbery. Only thing edible was the hasbrown and fries. Also the lady taking the orders and making the food went out of her way to say that they were \"making it fresh\" yeah right! What a waste of time and money.'b'One of the employees was extremely rude! She opened the glass and with an extremely bad attitude said HI! After that, it was nothing but constant attitude. 100% customer satisfaction? Definitely not.'b\"I have NEVER EVER been this upset about the NON service I have ever received from McDonald's... I am visiting from out of town and my son and I decided to go through this particular McDonald's for a sundae on the way back to the hotel. \\nWe waited in the drive thru line for well over 15 mins. WHAT a complete Cluster F---. \\nThe NON service is the EXACT reason why we absolutely CANNOT think to give fast food workers $15 an hour! What a joke! \\nI wish I would have taken a picture to post the image of the so called manager that came to the window to assist me! HA... Your so called management skills are lacking... She slammed the drive thru window on me when I questioned her on what was going on in the drive thru line, where you have a van spending over 5 mins. ordering and the employees fist bumping the customer and using profanity, while there are over 10 cars backed up just wanting to actually give McDonald's our money! \\nWell McDonald's you have ruined it for me! I am done and I will be calling corporate to discuss the MUCH LARGER issue you have with this particular store! FRIGHTENING that this is how customers are treated! \\nHard to even give it 1 star... it doesn't deserve that... keep driving and find a Carl's Jr or IN and OUT... I am sure they will value you as a customer more than these RUDE people!\"b\"If I could give no stars I would! ! ! !  This McDonald's  has the worst food ever...\\n\\nI have went on 2 different  occasions &amp; both times the food was disgusting, fries under cooked &amp; burger was rubbery. When I called to complain the manager basically called me a liar. The food didn't even taste like regular mcdonalds  food . I won't go to that location ever again.\"b\"This location is outdated and slow. Quality of food is sad. Today's visit is probably my last to this location. You can only burn me so many times before I give up. I have gotten nasty salads, a joke of a chicken sandwich and very slow service for the last time. I'm done. I noticed another review said how busy they always are. It's because they are so slow. That location could do so much more. They apparently have already alienated most of the locals.\"b\"What can I say...... It's McDonald's so it's not gourmet or fancy just simply fast food. I went through the drive thru  and they had no intercom/speaker u had to order at the window with no menu in front of you lol.

So far, I've always gotten very friendly service at this location. The hostesses are okay, but I've gotten nothing but friendly faces from servers. One of the things I love about this TGI Friday's is that they have the 3 different Ultimate Sangrias. I'm sure it's not the only TGI that has it, but for some reason, the TGI Friday's in the Bay Area do not have the Ultimate Sangrias. And let me tell you, the Ultimate Sangrias are sooooo good here. Great flavorful blend of wine, alcohol, juice, and sliced up fresh fruit in the drink.\\n\\nAs far as the food, there's not much to say about it. It's just greasy, fattening American food. I wouldn't come here for a meal, but I have to admit, a late night drink + one of their appetizers is YUMMY.\"b\"Why would a local go to a TGI Friday's inside the Orleans... good question.. that was definitely a lapse of judement! Fiance and I were looking for somewhere generic to eat lunch that was inbetween our offices.. I expected reliable, pretty good food\\n\\nI ordered the turkey burger with cheese. Burger came out without cheese and then the guy proceeded to bring me a cold slice of cheese on a plate when I noticed it had no cheese. The burger was so cold the cheese wouldn't melt.. eww. seriously, throw it on the grill for a minute, how lazy are you? Oh and the bun was stale.. and kept breaking off as I ate it.. and the burger sucked. Nothing good about it. Service was obviously bad too.\"b\"For where I was at and for the deal that TGIF usually has this place wasn't half bad.... I could have spent $50 a person and went to the Bellagio, but what would I do after I ate, gamble? Nay, here at the Orleans they have a 72 lane bowling alley. But that's for another review. \\n\\nThe servers are nice, but they had a lot of tables that were full so they were spread pretty thin, so I'll grant them some leniency.\\n\\nSo TGIF has a special going on here where it's buy one of the Jack Daniels Specials get another one free. Now that saves at least $14 off the bill and with a group of 5 with an overall bill of $45 we thought was pretty decent (that includes the drinks) so I'd go back here for a quick bite. But remember you're not going to leave here thinking that this is the best of Las Vegas, but you'll leave content that you filled yourself without going over budget. \\n\\nI wonder if Rachel Ray's still doing her $40 a Day show....? Well Enjoy.\"b\"This TGI Friday's is similar to the one at Gold Coast, with the same 24 hour happy hour specials. This place is not as good as the one at Gold Coast. The portions were a bit smaller, yet the food was still good.\"b\"The service was way better than the food until a large party came in, then the waiter couldn't handle the 3 tables he had. The drinks, (which was a Washington Apple) was served in a extra large shot glass instead of a martini glass. Worst of all, it tasted like cranberry with a squirt of Crown!  Last Friday's for me!\"b\"The food is decent and it's open very late, 2AM weekdays, 3am on weekends.  Since many of the restaurants in Vegas aren't open late at night, it's a very reliable standby to get some decent food late at night.\\n\\nThe Southwestern Mahi Mahi  or Shrimp Key West is great if you want something light, as many of the dishes tend to be on the heavy side, with alfredo-type sauces or cheese. I've also had their California Club (has avocado in it, very good) and one of the steaks (can't remember which one, but it was good).\\n\\nThey have a ton of different drinks, but if you don't drink alcohol, try the cherry limeade slush, very yummy &amp; refreshing.\"b\"Yeesh. The server was friendly and the place was open at 10pm. But it looks tired and dirty. From overuse not neglect. You have families with babies who drop fries all over the floor, spilled drinks, you name it. As for the food...must you ask? It's all the same, Chili's, TGIF, Applebee's, they get all their stuff from the same supplier. If you're a tourist, it's edible.\"b\"I was really disappointed with the service here. I went for a quick lunch on the Tuesday before Christmas and ordered  a draft beer and a burger. It took forever for the beer to come, even after I managed to intercept the server to ask about it. When it finally showed up it was flat, and I went through the process again to get a bottle instead, thinking they couldn't screw that up. Meanwhile, I could see the bartender practicing his bottle-flipping moves -and he wasn't very good at that either. The place was nearly empty but the server was usually nowhere to be seen. When the burger finally came, it was fine I guess, but I was too pissed off to enjoy it. I had to flag down caught the manager to get my check. Then I had to get her again to charge the meal to my room - they needed to use a different check for that, and no one asked me how I wanted to pay. The place was not very well run and seemed indifferent to the customers. I won't go back.\"b\"The clam chowder was kinda gross. But the lobster ravioli was delicious. The shrimp cocktail was pretty good, but its half price if u sit in the bar. The honey mustard chicken sandwich was gross. I couldnt even finish it, I had to leave and order something else in the food court. Waste of $. But I do have to say the angel hair pasta w/ grilled chicken and tomato &amp; fresh basil was good. That I would order again. Just be careful what you order. Don't order something out of the ordinary. Who knows how it might turn out.  PS the margaritas were WAY too sweet.\"b'TGI always good menu! The service was good and they have buckets of beer 5 for $10 and $5 margaritas. That is an awesome deal for any casino!!!'b'Ok this has to be the worst TGI\\'s I have ever been too. The sliders were cold and flavorless. My daughters pizza looked like cold pizza hut pizza. My husband asked for his steak to be med rare it came well done.  When he mentioned it to the server he had them make another one. This time it seemed like the cook said you want it \"rare mutha f\\'r\" here you go. It was browned on both sides and blue and cold in the center. I believe that is rare not med rate. So the manager came agreed and took the steak off our bill. The server seemed to busy to even bring us refills. I asked for 3 waters to make sure that we has plenty to drink incase we ran out. All around horrible go to fudruckers if your gonna eat here at the Orleans.'b'My recent visit to Fridays was great! I ordered a 22 oz. glass of Bud Light and my boyfriend ordered a bottle of Land Shark. Both of which were only $3.00 thanks to the happy hour special. They have great prices on alcohol and appetizers during happy hour (which just so happens to be all day everyday). I ordered the Gourmet 5 Mac &amp; Cheese, it was delicious! The boyfriend ordered the Jack Daniels burger and his was just as good. We had an amazing server named Margarita who was fast, very attentive, and provided awesome customer service. After both of our entrees and 4 beers, our total came to $25 and some change. I like that. The only thing I didnt like, is they didnt cater to the current promotion of all sandwiches and salads are $5 due to the fact that they are in a casino.'b'My husband and I ordered the Jack Daniel\\'s steak &amp; shrimp and the potstickers as an appetizer. As we were at our table I saw the bartender water down a couple of drinks (belonging to someone else) when they didn\\'t quite make it to the rim. Immediately turned around and saw in big letters on the wall \"Ultimate Cocktails.\" I couldn\\'t help but laugh. I\\'m SO not a drinker so I don\\'t even know if this is normal! Maybe a fellow yelper can clue me in? Anyway, potstickers were great as was the Ultimate Strawberry Shortcake we ordered for dessert. The steak was quite dry, the shrimp way too crunchy and the squash/zucchini was soggy. The Jack Daniel\\'s sauce, mashed potatoes and broccoli were good though.'b'I went to this TGIF yesterday, and i order the babyback ribs. I feel as though they have left it out for a while or it was overcook, and it was also really dry. and maybe they just put bbq sauce on the ribs, but i do enjoy their buffalo wings. it was spicy just the way i like it.'b\"I think T.G.I. Friday's is a fine establishment, especially for chain restaurants. But this spot is terrible. I've been here twice and have been thoroughly disappointed. The first time my problem was with the service. It took forever to be seated and to be served. The second time it was with the food. My wings were undercooked and my well done cheeseburger was pink. Then my date's well done burger was pink also, by that point she didn't even want to send it back because we already sent two things back. And on top of that the waitress took forever to return with the bill. I know some casino restaurants are crappy because they don't rely on repeat business and make it up with volume. But this one is pathetic. I will not be back to this one.\"b'This place sucks. The food is so expensive and tastes like shit. The gm is a nazi psycho who treats all employees like garbage so obviously theyre not in the best mood when they serve you. i hate them. fridays at home rules way harder than this stupid place'b\"the yards here are cheaper compared to that of the strip's.  but getting the yard to the strip can be rather tricky.\\n\\nSpecialty: American\\n\\nRecommendations for first timers: Jack\\n\\nService: 8/10 Variety: 8/10, Parking: 9/10 \\n\\nmarc out.\"b\"Dined: 4 / 1 / 2011 @ 10:33 pm\\n\\nOrdered:\\n Long Island Ice Tea\\n Mango Mai Tai\\n Nachos\\n \\n\\n  This T.G.I.Friday's is located inside the Orleans.  I came with my girlfriend and her brother.  Upon arrival there was no one in line.  I approached the hostess and she told me there would be a 10 minute wait if we wanted to have happy hour at the bar.  I gave her a confused looked as I glanced over to my right and saw 3 tabletops in the bar that were empty and prepped for the next guest.  I told her okay and sat on the 1 bench that they had for those who were waiting to be seated.  While waiting a couple came and was sat immediately in the regular dining area.  5 minutes after the couple's arrival, another group of 4 was sat immediately.  At this point, I was getting a little frustrated and just kept staring at the Hostess.  She stood there with two other hostess just talking amongst themselves.  She finally decided to seat us after  nearly useless minutes of wasting.  Within those 10 minutes, not one person left or entered the bar; so I have no clue what the wait was all about.  \\n\\n  We mainly came here for a late night snack and enjoy some happy hour drinks.  Luckily our waitress was really nice and serviced us immediately.  She was very bubbly and had lots of energy.  If it wasn't for her, I would have definitely rated this place a 2 star.  The food was good and the happy hour prices were phenomenal.  \\n\\nPros:\\n* conveniently located inside Orleans (movies, bowling, dining, food under one roof)\\n* Open late and TVs throughout the bar \\n* Quick service (at the bar)\\n\\nCons:\\n* Horrible service at the hostess stand \\n* Unprofessional demeanor at the hostess stand.\\n* Difficult parking\\n\\nTips:  \\n* Ask to just sit at the Bar itself (not a table in the bar area) for faster      seating.\\n* Sign up for their email list to receive points for future discounts and also receive a free appetizer via email confirmation message.\\n\\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but since the location is pretty convenient; I'll be fair and recommend this place to those who are not in favor or driving around kill the night.  This is a one stop shop and has numerous entertaining amenities to keep you busy and complete the night with cheap drinks/ cheap eats.\"b\"We were about to eat at Oyster Bar, but there wasn't a table to seat 8 people, so we went to TGI Friday's.  Wow, the food was actually pretty good.  Food from the kids' menu is just as big as the normal entrees.  If you have kids, order the ribs for $7, and you'll get more than a half-rack of ribs for half the price.  \\n\\nI ordered ribs and lobster.  The ribs were slightly overcooked.  I completely forgot that I was supposed to dip the lobster in the melted butter until we left.  I also tried the lobster carbonara pasta, which was the best out of all dishes.  The grilled shrimps from other entrees were nicely seasoned and grilled.  Overall, I enjoyed dinner.\"b'we came by for lunch after checking out. i wanted nachos and mama wanted a salad. i figured this would be an ideal spot to facilitate those needs.\\n\\nthe hostess who sat us was not very pleasant. she tried to seat us at the bar section, on a bar table. mind you, we have our luggage with us and didn\\'t ask to be seated at the bar. when i asked her for a dining room booth, she looked less than thrilled to be burdened with this task. she may have even rolled her eyes behind her glasses. \\n\\nour server was a nicer individual. we ordered nachos and mama had a cobb salad. mama gets picky with her orders sometimes. this time she didn\\'t get \"too\" picky. she did ask for NO bleu cheese though. we thought it was simple enough. i also asked for a lemon for my water. needless to say, i point those items out because they were not accomplished. the nachos were good and mama tolerated her salad. we ordered dessert, the brownie with ice cream. that was real good. \\n\\nwould\\'ve gone with 3 stars, cause the server was nice. but, the hostess and the missed items make me have to drop one. call it 2.5'b\"Before you ask what I was smoking when I gave this Friday's 4 Stars, hear me out.\\n\\nI came in here for a late dinner during the week. Probably around 9PM.  It wasn't too crowded and we got to sit down right away.\\n\\nThe service was slow, I think they were probably spread thin. But our waiter was very friendly and other servers seem to help each other out.\\n\\nThe food was pretty tasty,(I may have been hungry), but never the less I thoroughly enjoyed my Jack Daniels Steak and Shrimp Dinner.\\n\\nIt did take a while for our food to come out which was surprising since there were not a lot of people in the restaurant, but I have no idea what the kitchen size/situation is for that place.\"b'Happy hour makes this a good find.  They have a big margarita for six bucks.  Not bad.  Good flavor definitely not watered down.\\n\\nI gravitate towards the Jack Daniels menu items.  The ribs are 4 out 5 stars and they salads are definitely worth a look.'b\"This Friday's was cool. We went on a not so busy day so that was a plus. Idk about my friends but I enjoyed it. It was no different then the Friday's in California. My artichoke dip was on point and my pasta was delish. I'd recommend Friday's over the buffet that the hotel offered.\"b'I was here on the 4th of July because it was the only place open I could find at 11pm. Everything started off great. the hostess was nice and friendly. She gave us our menus and told us our server would be with us shortly.  It took him 10 minutes to finally show up. It wasn\\'t busy at all. Don\\'t know why it took him that long. He too our order for drinks and came \\nback 5 minutes later.  At this point, I\\'m starting to get annoyed.\\n\\n  We finally ordered and he took our order and seemed confused. We had to tell him 3 times exactly what we wanted.  20 minutes later, our hostess was bringing our food, not the server. WTF? She apologized for the delay. I looked across the room and saw our server handing drinks to another table. Really? We were waiting a long time.  We were all pissed at this time and to make matters worse, he got one of the orders wrong. Nothing remotely to what we wanted. We didn\\'t say anything because we wanted to eat and get the hell out.\\n\\n  I finished my drink and waited for the server to come by and offer a refill. I waited and waited and waited. He walked by our table at least 4 x and not once, bothered to check on how we were.  After 15 minutes, I finally got up and spoke to the manager. I explained to him what was happening and he asked me to described the server. I gave a brief description  and he stopped me by saying \"Oh, that\\'s Ryan\" with a bit of bite in his tone. I guess Ryan  has had complaints before. The hostess brought our drinks and apologized again.\\n\\n  When it came time for the check, he actually brought it to our table, the nerve of that guy. He came back to pick up the check and to clear the table. The server dropped silverware on me as he was taking a plate off the table. Good thing I ate everything or else food would have landed on me. That was the last straw. \\n\\n  I signed the slip and where it says TIP, I wrote NONE. DOESNT DESERVE ONE. I have always left a tip behind and am always generous with 18-20%, but not this time. The food was good, but the service was horrible. Only good thing was the hostess. I should have tipped her since she was doing his job.'b\"TGI  friday's\\nOne of my favorite places for a casual meal in a bar atmosphere!\\nMostly a fun place with mostly bar food. they're always busy so I give waiters a break if they take extra minutes for this or that.\\nThe food is always good I have tried almost everything on the menu and enjoyed every bite of it. This time I had the sirloin and baby back ribs and it was delicious. The desserts are out of this world and prices are down to earth. This is not a fast food restaurant, slow down and enjoy life! Try this place you'll enjoy it. Thank God I did.\"b\"This TGIF is horrendous if you sit anywhere, but the bar.  Slow service or no service every time I go eat there.  Then why do I go back?? Because my family put a gun to my head, tied me up,  and dragged me there so they can use their comps.  Ugh.  I noticed it doesn't matter which server I get.  They will seat you and sometimes it takes 10-15mins before anyone notices you didn't even get drinks or place settings. Then it takes another 15-20 mins before the server asks for your order.  Once you get your food, you better make sure you have everything you need when the server asks if you needed anything else otherwise you will not see her till she/he brings you the check.  It's like they go in the kitchen to chat or something.  The place isn't even busy during the times I've gone.  This franchise ruins TGIF's brand.\"b'I usually eat at the Fridays on Sahara but tried this one out last night because I was seeing a movie at the Orleans.\\n\\nI have been here before and usually have a bad experience but this time was different I actually had a good time.\\n\\nWe were sat immediately which is rare on a Saturday night at dinner time. Our server immediately greeted us and brought our drinks out right away. We ordered the Fried Green beans which came out hella fast and were delicious as always. \\n\\nI ordered the Jack Daniels Pulled Pork Sandwich which was tasty as always and my son had the kids pizza with fries and he scarfed that down.\\n\\nOverall this time I had a great experience service was good and food was delicious.'b'What can be said about TGI Friday\\'s that hasn\\'t already been said? Nothing. The correct answer is nothing. If you\\'ve been to one, you\\'ve been to all of them. No one is high-fiving about going there. No one is dropping to their knees in the rain crying \"NOOOOO!!\" with outstretched arms, either. The atmosphere is kitschy, the food is good but not great, the noise level is fairly high, the specials are decent. \\n\\nIf you\\'ve never been to a TGI Friday\\'s before (and if you have, I don\\'t know why you\\'re reading this), don\\'t expect amazing things. Expect a meal you\\'ll neither regret nor remember three days later. They do average better than anyone.'b'My co-workers and I have made our rounds to quite a few T.G.I. Fridays. The TGIF at the Orleans Hotel and Casino on Tropicana Avenue is our favorite. We usually sit at the bar for happy hour -- the food and drinks are inexpensive and the bartenders are quite conversational and very friendly. \\n\\nTGIF is generally a relaxed, fun atmosphere. The restaurant is clean and tidy, the service is great... We always have a good time! If you are in the mood to kick back with a few friends and grab some delicious snacks, then I would recommend the TGIF at the Orleans.'b'I\\'ve never reviewed a flat out franchise before, but I feel compelled to because I\\'ve never been to a TGI Friday\\'s before and, more importantly, I have too much time on my hands.\\n\\nNo, I didn\\'t go to Vegas to eat at TGI Friday\\'s. We really weren\\'t feeling that long buffet line though. We were seated quickly and a server came out of nowhere and yelled \"Hey HEY hey.\" Scared the hell out of me. I look at the menu and, unsurprisingly, most of that shit has meat in it. Even the salad! They chop up chicken and bacon in that shit. Mannn. I end up ordering this big ass potato with sauteed veggies in it. The heaviest vegetarian meal I\\'ve ever eaten. Pretty salty and really oily. Not really a complain, just something I noticed. \\n\\nServer was fine, food was adequate, I guess. I\\'ll probably never come back. There\\'s gotta be better restaurants in Las Vegas that aren\\'t in smoke-filled casinos.'b'Not amazing, not terrible. The green bean fries are pretty good but the rest of the menu is blah.'b\"Love the happy hour!\\n\\nThis T.G.l Fridays is located in the Orleans Casino which is the closes one to me because I live in the far South West of Las Vegas. First impressions cute place, my boyfriend and I were seated by the bar area in these cute little booths perfect for 2 people. I didn't know it but I went during happy which was awesome, they had a small but nice selection of half off drinks and appetizers. The customer service here was awesome, our waiter wow! I even think he was a trainee maybe thats why he was so nice. Usually I don't fall for up sales but this guy could talk. So he up sold me into ordering some onion soup. Which was delicious, I love onion soup but T.G.I fridays recipe was a lot different then the onion soups I've been eating idk it was delish! I order a tomato basil pasta that my friend suggested me. The portions were huge! which is totally okay with me I love taking home left overs. In total two entree's a few shrimp cocktails, drinks, and onion soup came out to about $70 for two. Decent price for a great date night.\"b'Our 1st waiter was a nightmare.  Took forever to take our drink order.  Once order took 1/2 hour for him to come back to take our dinner order...still have not received our drinks.  Had to ask several times where our drinks are.  Tables all around us sat down later, order later, but received drinks and food faster---different waiters.  I finally received my salad but it was hot (Yuck).  Then, Lucky for us he finally went on a break and we got a new waiter.  He was great.  He was on top of it all.  We got our food soon.  Food was still below par, but we would have almost ate anything due to that it took 1 1/2 hours for us to get our food.'b\"We ordered the Jack Daniel's burger along with the combo fries.  The burger was good but the Jack Daniel's flavoring was a little too sweet and thankfully they put it in a separate container.  I'm not a seet potatoe fries kinda guy but they were ok as well.  The service was good and the refills on our soft drinks were constant.  They even offered to make us a drink to go if we wanted to which is kinda cool.\"b'Good \"big box\" food joint, with lots of different options.  Nothing crazy good or crazy bad.  Chili\\'s fraternal twin.'b\"I know what to expect coming in to a place like this, food wise, but I wasn't prepared for how filthy it was.  The booth we sat in, right in front by the hostess stand, was just caked with crud on the walls.  Just sitting there made me feel dirty...but we were hungry, it was late, so we stayed.  The service was absolutely the WORST I have ever experienced.  Anywhere.  Our (frumpy) waitress never refilled our drinks, I had to chase down the hostess to get another round.  We waited about 50 minutes for our food to come out, and it was typical Friday's salty nosh.  The chicken with cheese was ok, although my ankles were swollen in the morning (as usual when I eat at Friday's the night before) due to the saltiness of their food.  \\nAfter having to watch the degenerate gamblers and obnoxious loud fat people stroll in and out of there all night, we wanted to leave.  The waitress gave us our bill then disappeared.  I tried to flag her down, but we waited at least 15 more minutes.  We got fed up, counted out enough money to leave for the bill, and were even generous enough to leave her a $.17 cent tip.  I normally leave at least a 20% tip, even for crappy service, but crappy sevice is better than NO service.  This place needs better management...\"b\"I was waiting for my room to be ready and noticed Happy Hour was just starting.  Haven't been in a TGI's in about 15 years.  Plenty of seating at the bar that early and I ordered a Bass and the potato skins app.  The potato skins would have been enough for 3-4 people and I pushed down all but one.  They were OK and an excellent value at $6.  Service was all right.\"b'TGI Fridays was on my radar as soon as the Las Vegas Wranglers kicked Colorados A*% @ the CMYE Hockey party. GO WRANGLERS..WOO HOO! \\n\\nJust having stadium nachos and three beers during a 3 hour game was definitely, not the end of my dinner plans for the night. My wife and I rushed over as soon as the game ended and sat in the bar. Our server was Ricky. He\\'s a low talker for sure, but very nice, and knew what to say and when to say it. Fridays is just like every other commercialized restaurant around the universe. Old records, pictures, random rowing oars hanging on the walls, and constant striped patterns everywhere you look (probably even on the toilet seat covers). But they do have one thing that I was super stoked to see. They have a bell that you are supposed to ring if you received excellent service. Now, when I see a bell, all I want to do is ring it.....hard! I was hoping Ricky, would be killer in the service game, so I could ring that bell. Fingers were crossed.\\n\\nTo start out, my wife really wanted the \"Loaded Potato Skins\"(refer to pic), which I have never had before, anywhere. So I figured, alright, I\\'m down. They weren\\'t exactly \"Loaded\", or very good. Bacon, yes, is always good on everything, BUT.. the thing they go on still has to have flavor! It can\\'t just be some semi-soggy, piece of cardboard. Anyways, no bueno on the skins. \\n\\nFor our entrees, we both ordered the \"Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich\"(refer to pic). The sandwich looked good, and came with (over)seasoned fries. The sandwich alone was pretty bad, but when you drizzle the delicious Jack Daniels BBQ sauce all over, it becomes pretty tasty! Not amazing by any means, but good. The fries that came with were just way over seasoned. They were so salty, I found myself shaking each one, trying to knock off all the seasoning, before attempting to eat them. During this ongoing battle with my food, Ricky brought both of us refills, made some small chat, and ended with a smile. I\\'m not big on complaining about food, and figured it wasn\\'t that big of a deal at the time. \\n\\nFor dessert we had the Chocolate Caramel, and Pecan Explosion (forgot the name, but thought this sounded awesome)(refer to pic). This dessert was actually very good. It put a nice, big smile on our face\\'s. The chocolate brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream, and chopped pecans. Very moist brownie, covered in rich, flowing chocolate sauce. Nomnom.\\n\\nBefore we left, I had to ring that bell. Ricky was a good server, and I went for the bell. Let me tell you..., it felt so good to ring that bell, I would go back just for that feeling again. All-in-all, bell ringing is amazing and everyone should have a good bell ring daily. Head to Fridays for your bell fix today.'b'Terrible service. Went on Super Bowl night and after being seated we waited for 15 minutes without  even one server coming to our table to greet us much less take our order. We saw 5 servers watching the game instead of doing their job so we left. On the way out we spoke to the  hostess about the problem. She apologized, but they need to do a better job.'b\"Just terrible. Sat down and didn't see a server for 10 minutes. Took our orders and had to track her down afterwards. \\nThe salad was HORRIBLE and was so limp, i couldn't pierce it with my fork. \\nAfter asking and being informed that they had one large hopper of lettuce, she even asked if i wanted another salad. HELLO!!!!! It's the same lettuce!!!!!! Just bad bad bad all around.\"b'This is usually my go to place at the orleans for drinks and having a good dinner! I love the Jack D ribs and shrimp combo. Service is pretty good! Only waited a couple of minutes before a waiter showed up. Food is always hit the spot!'b'Absolutely terrible food. Paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me. The wait staff are superb, and very nice. The Orleans has other places to eat on site, so avoid this one at all cost.'b\"Decided to try here with a friend for happy hour as it was the closest one to us. This TGIF is located inside the Orleans casino. The wait wasn't too long even though it seemed fairly busy.\\nIt was sad to hear they didn't participate in the $3 Thursday appetizer &amp; drinks or 2 for $10 app n entree. They did have a happy hour that had different specials. $6 appetizers cept for seafood and samplers. $3-4 beers and well drinks, $5 sangrias and $6 ultimate drinks. We caught them near the end of their midday happy hour, no specials between 7-9pm. By the time my friend wanted to order a 2nd drink, our server informs us that happy hour had ended. Not that it was required, but most places I go for happy hour usually my server will be courteous enough to give a heads-up when happy hour's about to end so we can get our orders in. Maybe I'm spoiled? haha\\nFood was ok, nothing amazing, nothing horrible for the most part. My friend's cheesecake apparently had been sitting out too long as the outside of it was pretty hard and dried. Next time I want happy hour at TGIFridays I might have to try another location and hope they participate in the good specials.\"b'We don\\'t have a TGI Friday\\'s in my hometown, so my boyfriend and I specifically planned to visit this location on our recent trip to Vegas.\\n\\nWe were seated right away, which is always nice.  We then waited at our table for 10-15mins for anyone to even greet us or smile our direction.  When our server finally arrived, the FIRST words out of her mouth were \"I\\'m exhausted.\"  She then proceeded to complain to us about her last table as an excuse as to why we had to wait so long just to get waters.\\n\\nWe had enough time to decide what to order as we waited so long.  I decided to try the special the hostess told me about: steak and lobster for $13.99.  What I didn\\'t know is that it was on a time limit.  The server had the nerve to look at her watch after making us wait 15 minutes and tell me I \"barely made it\" in time to order that.  I also order a cocktail at this time.\\n\\nAfter waiting another 10 minutes, she finally brought my sangria followed by another 15-20 minute wait for our entrees.  Let me tell you.  This was the MOST unappetizing meal I\\'ve ever had to eat.  I am not usually a complainer--even when I\\'m starving I eat some pretty crazy foods.\\n\\nThe lobster was not \"de-turded (for lack of a better word)\" and my medium rare steak was too tough to chew.\\n\\nWe did speak to the store manager who willingly comp\\'ed us some items, but I left underwhelmed and still hungry after not being able to bring myself to finish my meal.'b'My husband and I were in Vegas just last week, April 16-20, and we stayed at the Orleans, which is where this particular Friday\\'s is located.  If I could, I would give a \"0\" star rating.  It will be a very long time, if ever, before we return.  \\n\\nWe decided to eat at Friday\\'s on Friday evening, April 19, which was our last day in Vegas. After having a drink or two at the Alligator Bar, we decided we wanted something to eat.  We walked over to Friday\\'s and it was only about 11:45 p.m.  We were the only 2 people waiting in line and the hostess was nowhere in sight.  We saw people cleaning up tables and mopping the floors, and finally a gal looked over and asked us if we\\'d like to be seated.  That should have been my first indication that the dining experience was only going to go down from there.  \\n\\nWe were seated, and Sara, a server, came over to take our drink order.  After a few minutes, she came back to take our dinner order.  My husband ordered a chicken dish and also a Caesar\\'s salad.  Sara placed our food order and that was  about the last time she paid attention to us.  She totally forgot about my husband\\'s Caesar\\'s salad.  Evidently she felt it was more important to stand in the hallway and take pictures of some balloons that were up front.  Besides Sara, there were 4-5 other Friday\\'s employees doing the same thing.  It was more important that they look at the pictures on their cell phones instead of paying attention to their customers!  \\n\\nConsidering the restaurant was hardly busy, we waited about 30 minutes before our food came out.  When it did, it was just absolutely horrible.  My husband\\'s chicken dish was so salty he could barely eat it; and the cheese that covered the chicken was totally burnt in many places.  I ordered Korean tacos (I think that\\'s what they were called) and I was not impressed at all.  Very little meat; too many greens carelessly tossed inside the corn tortillas; and it didn\\'t look or taste anything like the way it was described in the menu. Right before our food came out, Sara came over to our table to tell my husband that she \"just realized\" she forgot his salad!  Of course she did, because the cell phone was far more important to her!  Thankfully, we were not charged for the salad.  \\n\\nIn the meantime, two more diners came into the restaurant.  They, too, were totally ignored by the employees.  Finally, the gentleman had to literally chase down a server and asked them if Friday\\'s was still open!  Finally, after about 5-7 minutes, this couple was seated.  \\n\\nBy this time, my husband and I were so upset we decided that we needed to speak to a manager.  Sara came over to ask how our food was, my husband said it wasn\\'t a good experience and he wanted to talk to a manger.  Sara did get the manager and we expressed our displeasure.  The manager was nice enough to not charge my husband for his dinner and she did give us some gift certificates for complimentary appetizers and desserts.  However, the entire experience left me with very negative feelings about Friday\\'s.  \\n\\nI don\\'t know who does the training at this particular Friday\\'s, but something is sorely missing.  Since when does a hostess station remain empty on a Friday night?  Customers should NOT have to chase down employees in order to get seated.  And the servers should not be standing in the hallway looking at pictures on their cell phones!  This is not \"service\".  After we complained to the manager, all of a sudden, the servers were doing their jobs.  It shouldn\\'t have had to come to that!  Sara was one of the worst servers I\\'ve ever had.  If she\\'s that poor of a server on a relatively slow night, I cringe to think how she is when it\\'s busy!  Needless to say, Sara was not given a tip.  We do not tip for poor service and forgetfulness.  \\n\\nWe\\'ve eaten at this Friday\\'s in the past and we always had good food and service.  What happened on the Friday night we were there was just inexcusable.  If Sara and company don\\'t want to work on a Friday night, they picked the wrong industry.  I do not recommend this Friday\\'s at all, unless you enjoy being ignored, forgotten and served sub-par food.  I don\\'t, and that\\'s why I won\\'t be returning to Friday\\'s when I stay at the Orleans in the future.  I\\'d rather get a bag of junk food from the Orleans\\' gift shop before I go back to Friday\\'s!'b\"Go for the 13.99 Steak and Lobster special, stay for the...well, don't stay. Just eat and leave, cause this is TGI Friday's and the rest of Las Vegas is just outside your door!\\n\\nServers were friendly, food was average, decor was as expected...everything was just as expected. If you've made the mistake of staying in Vegas too long and you want to feel like you're back at TGI's wherever you're from...well, this one is here for you.\"b\"Everything was wonderful from the food to the waitstaff! \\n\\nEveryone's food was fresh and delicious. I'd certainly eat here again!\"b\"Good God...parmesan meatballs!   Take a meatball, bread it, deep fry it, and serve it with marinara and mozzarella!  Just wish the service was more consistent.  We ate here more than once on the trip.  Lunch was great - greetings at the door, prompt/friendly service, and good food.  The late night dining not so much.  No greeter, no water when we ordered, no silverware with the food, no one to bring the check.  Hmmmm...  Need a little work.  I understand it's late, but if the restaurant is going to offer late night hours they need to be sure the guest experience is up to standards.\"b'All I want to eat at TGI Friday\\'s is the Baby Back Ribs, but my husband talked me out of it, and we did the appetizer \"grazing\" thing.  I was pleasantly surprised.  We had the Thai Pork Tacos, Parmesan Meatballs, Bacon Mac and Cheese Bites, and the Loaded Potato Skins.  It was awesome!  \\n\\nOur waiter was VERY attentive and offered to re-fill my soda several times.  He was right there when my husband finished his beer and quickly offered to get him another.  \\n\\nI soooo miss TGI Friday\\'s in Hawaii!!!'b'Pretty good service. The appetizers were amazing and love the happy hour!! Bartender and hostess were nice!'b\"We like coming here for one reason excellent service.  We are regulars at this place and we really appreciate the customer service from all the managers.  In the past they have helped us so many times.\\n\\nKristen was our waitress today, she's nice.   She knows what we drink by heart and will always take care of us.  She really knows the meaning of customer satification.\\n\\nWhile we were here watching the NFL Jets vs. Pats game.  A tall bartender that saw a customer left his suitcase and he tried to get it back to him.  How nice was that?  Hopefully that man remembered where he left it..\\n\\nI'm sure we'll be back for more half priced apps, I even signed up for a stripes card.  In the bar area Mon-Sat from 5 PM - 7 PM &amp; 9 PM - 2 AM is half priced apps. On Sunday are half priced apps ALL DAY.\\n\\nSign up for their Give Me More Stripes account, opt for the emails &amp; text messages if you can.  I get amazing email offers every so often. I also fill out the surveys on the receipt for an $8 app.\"b\"How this place gets a two star and others get a 4 rating mystifies me. The food is predictably good. It isn't a top line steakhouse, but you don't pay those prices. Not to mention that it is designed to accommodate sports fans with the numerous televisions. \\nThe staff is courteous and they have great specials. We had steak and lobster for $15. We took advantage of the special a couple of times while there. I like TGIF's in general, and this being in a great casino, Orleans, is just an added benefit.\\nI will definitely go back the next time we visit in a few months!\"b'I love TGIF ever since but I never wrote a review.  The food is good, the dessert is not to miss and their happy hour on drinks is cherry on top.  This one inside The Orleans is great place to dine after or before going to the movies or bowling (or to gamble for the gamblers).'b\"We are locals in Las Vegas, we get tickets to concerts at the Orleans, so tgi's is the logical place to eat. Not the best, service there is not very good, it is hit and miss, sometimes we get great service sometimes horrible service! We went there on Nov. 10th for the Kenny Wayne Shepherd concert, the hostess sat us and took our drink orders and only brought water, not the beer my hubby order. We had to order from a waitress, did that got our drinks and appitizer, but hubby ordered the garlic shrimp that was supposed to be served on risotta style rice, uh what is that?? We thought risotta, not so..just burnt rice, in fact it was all burnt. We had no time to re order as we had a concert to get to. Just be sure when you go, order a burger or basic food, get there with plenty of time in case you bad service. Don't expect too much!\"b'Once again I stopped going to the other location on W Sahara because twice the baby back ribs were dry and hardly any meat. This was just so so and not much better then the one on Sahara. I used to order the Ribs a lot at the Sahara location and it used to be good, they must be buying real cheap and not meaty ribs. Done with them.'b'I have had annoying visits with the Fridays in the past, but I decided to give it another try. I am pleased I did. I came in with my boyfriend for apps and drinks before a Tuesday movie. \\n\\nThe Service: Very fast and the server was very friendly. \\nThe Drinks: Exactly what I expected\\nThe Food: YUM. We shared their new \"tapas\" menu. I LOVED the Mac bites. My boyfriend cant wait to try their meatballs again. \\nThe Price: $40, not great but not bad either. \\n\\nThe only downfall? I was too full for a whiskey cake for dessert.'b\"Pretty good experiences all the times we've been here.\\n\\nWe love the Jack Daniels grilled items and sauce. Parmesan steak fries are amazing by the way.\\n\\nThis time our server Christina (with red tinted hair) was pretty awesome. Our drinks was always refilled and we had everything we needed from the get go. She did an awesome job and I would recommend to ask for her, especially since past reviewers are unhappy with the other waitresses service.\\n\\nFood is pretty decent for a chain restaurant. Nothing too spectacular, however nothing extremely horrible. For thai tacos, two steaks and shrimp,two sides, and sodas the bill was $61, not bad!\"b'Had dinner here before a Wranglers game on a Friday night. I was cautiously optimistic about eating here because I know these kinds of places can be hit or miss, but we had a nice time. \\n\\nThere was a pretty long line outside waiting for tables (both dining room and bar) but it went by fast. We sat in the bar area to have the Happy Hour specials. $6 apps, $5 sangrias, $3 bottled beer. \\n\\nThe Food: We got the pretzel sticks, pretty yummy, I think they were fried, which is different than I am used to, but I still liked them. Potato skins were yummy, good sized and there were a ton of them. Loaded skillet chip nachos were delicious, loved the cheese. \\n\\nThe Drinks: Raspberry Sangria, pretty sweet, definitely needed food to help balance it out, but I enjoyed it. \\n\\nThe Service: Everyone from the hostess to the waitress was very nice. Waitress was very attentive and checked up on us several times.\\n\\nOverall a good dinner experience and a place I would certainly choose over a Chilis or Applebees.'b\"I've never eaten a a TGIFridays before so when we got a two for one coupon in the mail I decided to give the place a try. I ordered the Stacked Blue Cheese Burger and what a mistake that was. The burger was so salty it was almost uneatable. I made through about half of it before giving up. If I do eat there ever again I plan to eat only salad because now I don't trust the meat seasoning. Worse experience ever with a restaurant meal.\"b\"American restaurant, bar, dim lighting, and don't forget a big screen TV at the bar area. Unfortunately it's not all around the restaurant. The service we had was nice, food came out fast and hot. \\n\\nI got the shrink chicken pasta and it was served with a spoon.. They gave me a spoon so I had to wait about 5 minutes for the server to come by again to get a fork and the top layer was already cold. I would come here once in a while, not often though.\"b'I am grading the food. To me, the basics have to be right before I can judge the whole meal. I like soup and salad along with my meal and I REALLY wanted salad with blue cheese dressing. Turns out they are serving a \"new White Cheddar Broccoli soup\" which is one of my favorites. Soup should not plop, should not be goopy and shouldn\\'t look like someone just opened campbells cream of mushroom and dumped it cold into your bowl. Yes, it was hot, but still that is how it looked and it tasted like overly salted canned soup. I guess you can\\'t mess up lettuce but the \"blue cheese dressing\", pretty sure that was straight mayo. For these two items, which tonight were all I ordered, they were TERRIBLE! I paid my tab and left after two bites (one of each).  I have had other meals here that were okay, not superb or even great but mediocre. I just think that the basics should be considered.'b'The prime rib loft should take a lesson frim these guys! Busy Monday night these guys rocked! Got me seated n the bar server was very busy food was hot beer cold not rushed and felt like I was at hone. It kinda stunks eatung alone but my server took great care of me! comort food and a couple of beers!!'b\"Horrible ribs, horrible service, I will never come back here again. I am speaking this as a person who used to work as a waiter back in my college days. At first, we ordered bbq baby back ribs and food was overcooked and dry. Waiter's name was Dean and he was clumsy, nearly dropped the food at my friend. Well, s*** happens. I used to be a waiter for a sushi restaurant and I've had my bad days. So we were compensated by getting different entree. By the time we got our food, we lost our appetite but still finished the shrimp pasta. We asked for our check to pay the bill. It took him 20 minutes to close our tab because he couldn't get his priorities straight. I recall having bad, clumsy days, such as putting entrees one over the other and end up squashing the bottom entree, spilling drinks, but I've never kept my patrons waiting. I would close out the tabs and let the patrons go so that new customers can come and take the seats. I would never come here again. Rather go to oyster bar next door or drive outside since there are so many restaurants. I've had enough patience and tolerance with this place since I used to be a waiter myself.\"b\"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #156 - #365\\n\\nIt was my last night at the Orleans and I wanted to have some cheap before going back to the room. Walking around the casino, I saw TGIF, figured it's just like any other Fridays.\\n\\nThere was no wait so I just quickly walked in and sat in the bar area. Service was quick and I ordered a glass of beer and some chicken wings. Food was on par like with any other Friday's franchise and the wings were tasty with mild wings sauce. \\n\\nLucky for me I was able to charge it to my room so I cab earn some points for my stay.\"b\"Convenient location in the casino. Slow service though and sirloin was not that good tonight- lined with a layer if tough fat. Used my entertainment book coupon so that helped and nice that you can charge to your room. We 'll be back but I'll order something different.\"b\"decided to go out for a late night dinner and ended up at tgi Fridays in the Orleans. Our server's name was Julie...I think. Gave us the WORST service ever. Looked like she was in hurry because she dropped off our and check at the same time. Like expected us to just eat and leave. So we tipped her the minimum of 15% because of her lack of service.\"b\"Dinner after our movie date night! It was a clean setup and friendly service. We got seats in a timely manner. Our waitress was funny and gave great dessert suggestions so I truly appreciated that.\\n\\nI wasn't too happy at the end of the meal when I saw the bill. Not because I was charged for something I didn't get but because for the amount we paid we could've gotten the French market buffet next door all day pass. I got ribs and lobster so the prices seemed appropriate. However, after it was time to pay one tends to correlate the price you pay to the satisfaction one feels. And I didn't feel fully satisfied. The food was good but not $60 good. The only thing I really enjoyed was the Oreo ice cream pie dessert. If it hadn't been for that I would've probably given a 1 star review. Also like I said, my server was nice so luckily for TGIF it was fine there too.\\n\\nBut from now on I will probably go there just for that dessert, nothing else there is worth that kind of money.\"b\"Last visit to vegas went to the one at the aliante, which I would say is better overall esp in service and atmosphere. Got the $10 unlmtd app- potato skin &amp; buffalo wings. Potato skins couldve had more on them, and when I bit into a rotten skinned one and asked to get something else since they're all $10 I was told no but could get a new order. Dissapointing. Waitress was pretty good but the atmosphere of an older group staring@ me &amp; my husband was akward. Is it cuz we r interracial? Got more food than u? Idk... but made me u comfortable. Went at 1am btw. And all potato skin orders had @ least 1 rotten skinned spot on a potato. Not too good wont suggest that to anyone. Beach bum drink (alcoholic) sucked. Mostly pineapple juice &amp; no garnishes. \\n\\nWings were good and so were the ultimate grand margaritas. Prob wont come again though\"b'I went from saying \"Thank god it\\'s Friday\" to saying \"this is the worst diarrhea I\\'ve ever had\" on Saturday.'b'As a chain I like TGIF due to their Jack Daniels Ribs which are outstanding, but I came to the TGIF in \"The Orleans\" because a buddy wanted to hit up some $10 all you can eat appetizers. \\n\\nWe chose mozzarella sticks and boneless wings. \\n\\nMozzarella sticks were fresh and tasty with hot melted cheese right out of the fryer but they don\\'t give you enough marinara so we had to keep asking. They sprinkle some parmesan on top which is nice.\\n\\nBoneless wings never tasted like they were hot and fresh but not bad considering we got 4 orders of each...that\\'s 8 appetizers for $20.\\n\\nService was extremely friendly but the servers minds were on another planet\\n1. Ordered boneless wings...were brought potato skins the first time.\\n2. Ordered Dr. Pepper, got diet coke.\\n3. Ordered blue cheese for wings, got ranch...told them again we wanted blue cheese, NOT ranch...still brought us ranch.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the New Orleans is horrible, we were sitting at the tables outside near the casino and for 20 minutes the alarms were going off inside the casino as though there was a fire...and the alarm kept going and going and going...no one turned it off for a crazy amount of time considering it was a false alarm...didn\\'t enjoy eating through that. \\n\\nAlso parking there is ridiculous.'b'I was here about two weeks ago, but forgot to write a review. Food was good, loved the peach sangria, but our server was horrible. My friend left our table to go to the bathroom. She passed by our server who was talking sh*t about us to  the other servers. Rude! Never coming back! We still tipped her 20% since we all work in the restaurant industry. I regret doing that, what were we thinking!?'b\"This place always has great food! Very impressed that our server Lance and his co workers handled our huge party of 28! Some seemed a little overwhelmed at first but it was pretty smooth rolling. Its always good to have a server that is laid back with a good sense of humor :) Loved the beer combinations. I had the snakebite. Great combo! Can't beat the Jack Daniels Burger! Yum! Kudos to the staff!\"b'This is the worst fridays. I have given them chance after chance and they always get my orders wrong and the quality is severely lacking. Dont eat here'b\"-Waited for a table for 15 minutes, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. \\n-Waited 15 minutes for our server to greet us &amp; take our drink order, again there was 6 tables occupied. \\n-Server was the SLOWEST I've ever had! \\n-Waited about 30 minutes to order our food!\\n-Had to wait another 15 minutes for our SERVER to bring eating utensils then said I'm sorry I made you eat with your hands!!! (Good thing we ordered appetizers!)\\n-Tried to speak with a manager was told they were really busy.\\n-Last but not LEAST emailed Guest Relations, was promised a phone call back, never received ANY contact back from ANY TGIF member(s). \\n-WILL NEVER GO TO A TGIF!\"b\"We love coming here to eat. Before we get seated at a table, we always ask for Brooke. She's amazing...fun to talk with in general. She's our go to server when available. Food is always great, you can't miss out on their dessert either. I love that it's at a casino. We always play a little after lunch. Or watch a movie upstairs at their theatre.\"b\"Our waiter was from Detroit and way cool dude. Bottomless boneless wings were very good and able to take a bunch home. The bar area was loud and didn't like that.\"b\"Wish I could give LESS than one star as this was the WORST dining experience I've EVER had. Food AND service were BEYOND terrible. We had salmon with lobster and steak with lobster.  No amount of steak sauce or ketchup could improve the taste of the rubbery food. These miserable entrees took OVER 35 minutes to arrive and were BOTH cold!  The waitress, Autum, had no explanation for the delay and did not return to our table to refill our almost $4.00 drinks! She further dragged her feet with with the bill. Took almost ten minuets to bring the bill and another to charge us.  The manager offered free desserts as compensation but I did NOT want to waste any more of my time or taste any other awful dishes from this establishment, which I will never return to.\"b\"We used to love to go to this TGI Friday's but about a year ago the service &amp; quality of food was degraded. Yesterday we decided to give them another try using take out because I was having a meeting for lunch. \\n\\nWhen I walked in there was no one waiting for a table and 3 staff members standing around chatting. I said, I wanted to place a take out order. The young man pointed me in the direction of the bar and said at the end is where they take the orders from the bartender. \\n\\nOk 1st of all its a SUNDAY in a CASINO in LAS VEGAS. the bar was packed. no seats at the bar or any of the tables. I hipped my way though the crowd and stood at the end of the bar. \\n\\n25 minutes. \\n\\n1 bartender. \\n\\nWho puts 1 bartender in a bar on a Sunday in football season in Vegas?  \\n\\nI waited. \\n\\nand waited.\\n\\nand waited. \\n\\nShe talked to the service station people. she chatted up the people at the bar. she flirted with the guy who was sitting 3 seats down from where I was standing. she chatted with 2 girls who were standing next to me having a convo but NEVER once said.. CAN I HELP YOU. \\n\\nfor 25 minutes. \\n\\nI had all my order prewritten on a green post it (so if anyone from this Friday's is reading you'll know who i was) \\nFinally a woman in street clothing came behind the bar and have a few minutes of chit chat -- she (the bartender) pointed in my direction. she came over - not that she could hear me, so i gave her my list and asked if she could understand it.. THEN the bartender decided to come peek over her shoulder. I said.. Do you know how long it will take (thinking i'd sit in the lobby) she said at least 30 minutes.. I said well i've been standing here 25.  The bartender rolled her eyes and said.. we're really busy. \\n\\nReally?  I didn't notice. \\n\\nat which point i snatched my list back and left. but not before making a sweep though the dining room to count 12 tables. \\n\\nand the 3 staff members were back in the lobby chatting. \\n\\nNow my biggest issue is that who in the TGI Friday's corporate HQ thought it would be a GREAT idea for 2go orders being placed in a bar?  \\n\\nto go - unless you are in NYC or SFO - usually means you are going to get into your car and drive. \\n\\nI actually ended up at a stand alone TGI Fridays about 3 miles away. again sent to the bar to order and this time very prompt service but the bartender kept coming over and saying are you sure you dont' want a drink? finally i said. drinking and driving don't mix. \\n\\nWTG Fridays. You win the day.  (that's sarcasm, btw)\"b'Long wait for a drink , no silverware and the most disgusting bowl of what they call clam chowder. Booooo'b'We always enjoy at least one meal at this TGIF each time we stay at The Orleans, which is 2-3 times a year. We\\'ve never had bad service. We have had times where servers didn\\'t check on us because they were busy with too many tables at once, which usually means they\\'re understaffed, but this one always has a lot of employees working at the same time, mainly chitchatting at the hostess section up front, so I\\'m not sure what the issue is. The food is generally good. The 3-6 steak and lobster \"bargain\" isn\\'t really, you get about 2 bites of overcooked lobster tail. My biggest complaint is the dinner side salads. I always have a Caesar salad when I eat at any TGIFs - don\\'t think I\\'ll be doing that with this location anymore. Their dressing tastes like a lime vinaigrette... not disgusting, but not Caesar, either - and I always seem to get lots of the \"nasty\" bits of lettuce, which I leave in the bowl, it\\'s just a waste to order a salad here. Other than a few issues, this location is decent - not a fave, but it\\'s better than the trouble of leaving the hotel and dine elsewhere. Plus we always get a BOGO dessert coupon when we check in, so that helps!'b\"Worst fckn experience ever! We went here last week after watching hunger games and this rude ass host (young girl w/ glasses) just literally looked at us for a few seconds and looked away after we asked to seat a group of 6 people...like are you fckn kidding me?! We asked again and mind you, we asked politely. She never acknowledge us after that...she looked miserable w/ her job. I've never been so fckn pissed in my life that this stupid, rude Bitch had to ruin Fridays. My friends and I were so appalled that we decided to go somewhere else.\"b\"Really like Happy Hour here. The price is right!    My only complaint, which is not unique to Fridays, it's a lot of bars, is the seating that is 97% high tables. I use a wheelchair, and there is only one table in the bar at my height, otherwise, the table is at my eye level. I was accommodated by the staff and the understanding people at the one low table, but I would hope I wouldn't be forced to eat/drink at a high table to enjoy the Happy Hour prices only available in the at area.\"b\"Let's just say right on time. Sunday night with my lady happy hour almost everything. The staff on top of there game for a Sunday Funday. Relax drink eat an appetizer and caught up on espn with friends or whom ever. This TGIF was prefect for being on this inside of a casino.\"b'This is a great place to chill out. My girlfriend &amp; I came at 11pm on a Sunday, it was still happy hour until midnight. We ordered Jack Daniels Sauce Chicken Wings, Shrimp &amp; Margaritas. I was full &amp; a little tipsy when i left. Our server was great very friendly and attentive :)'b\"So, we were here on a trip from San Diego, we usually stop by or stay at The Orleans and we always stop in at Friday's for a bite to eat.  Either a meal or just snacks.  We have always liked this spot.  Very convenient and friendly.  However there certainly seems to be a change, and it's not for the better!  We were in a bit of a hurry, there was a little bit of a line to be seated in the dinning room, so we chose to sit in the bar.  All we wanted was skins, a cocktail and an ice tea.  So we sat at a bar table, and nobody paid any attention to us.  So I got up and walked over to a lady behind the bar and patiently waited for her to take a quick break from chatting with an obvious regular customer.  She never acknowledged me, Laura went to another bartender and asked for someone to take our order.  She was rudely told that we waited because we sat ourselves in the bar.  The lady said she would send someone over, but sure made it seem like we were putting her out.  Laura mentioned her treatment to the manager, who spoke with the bartender (before we got our drinks... EEK)!  Sure seemed like the waitress thought we complained about her, because she  barely said a word to us for the first time or two she stopped by, but then warmed up and was OK.  So we asked to speak with the manager again, about the whole situation.  She apologized and made excuses.  I explained that we have been coming here for 5 or so years, and have always been treated well, but this time was certainly different.  I asked her if she ever looks at the Yelp reviews for her store, she said no.  They have their own review system and don't care about Yelp.  I told her she really should.  I explained that Yelp is HUGE now, and she could learn a LOT about her store.  Well the skins did arrive and they were OK, nothing to make us go out of our way for again.  Certainly unless Yelpers start giving this place a better rating we won't go out of our way to eat here again.   The manager did comp the cocktail, but we were running well behind our expected time, but it worked out.\"b\"So when you are at the Orleans for a cheer competition and you need lunch and a Bloody Mary STAT you find yourself at TGIF's. We aren't big chain restaurant fans but there wasn't much else that we could find...\\nImmediately the hostess gave us attitude and we almost left, but with no where else to go we tucked our tails and sat down. From then on we were pleasantly surprised.\\nOur waitress was fabulous, cheery and helpful. Our food came quickly and it was pretty decent. Salmon can be scary at diners but my husband said his was great. My salad was fresh and tasty and my Bloody Mary was excellent. My daughter had a burger, it was a little lukewarm but the burger itself was tasty. \\nJust put someone a little less annoyed with life at the front desk and you will be a fine establishment ;)\"b\"The food was alright like any other tgif but our server ignored us, i think she saw us maybe 3 times never re-filled my coffee, This was far the worst Friday's I have ever been too, I will not be going to TGI fridays again. Service was bad, food was mediocre at best\"b'Very good service. We came in on Thursday in March during NASCAR week. 5 minute wait. Clean restaurant. Food well made.'b'Great bartenders, good service and tasty food.  This location is inside The Orleans.  They always have spots open at the bar.'b'I am not a big fan of chain restaurants but my sister and I decided to grab dinner at Fridays when we were at the Orleans last night.  We were seated immediately and experienced perhaps the best service I have had for a long time.  A young gentleman named Mars.  He was prompt and the perfect blend of efficient and friendly.  We both ordered the Parmesean-crusted chicken and were not disappointed.  Everything on the plate was awesome.  Some of the moistest chicken breast I have ever eaten.  I will eat there again when I am at the Orleans.'b\"Had lunch here the other day, unfortunately! Worse food &amp; service I have had in a long time.\\nServer took 3 attempts to bring a round of waters and a tea for 7 people. There were only 3 other occupied tables during lunch. First sign this was going to go south..quickly. Finally placed our order, a girl in the group placed a to-go order. Her to-go order came out after 2 girls received their salads after 20 minutes and still no appetizer. When the fool finally came out after 45 minutes half of the orders were cold and the other half were burned. \\nManager attempted to make our experience right by taking 20% off, this didn't make up 2 of the girls not eating any of their food.  \\nDon't waste your time? Better luck at a fast food joint.\"b'Our Server Lance was great, friendly, courteous, and genuine.  The food was great and, the company was even better.'b'Not usually a fan of chains, we got roped into going here by another couple, on our last night in Las Vegas. \\n\\nWe asked the hostess if the appetizers were still half price at Happy Hour. She said they were, but neglected to tell us one has to be seated at the bar to take advantage of the half price offer. \\n\\nWe only ordered one appetizer, and shared it: the shrimp cocktail... and unfortunately it appeared to have been made ahead of time as the shrimp were very dry. They weren\\'t \"bad\", they were just dried out, which can happen quite quickly in low humidity and air conditioning. So it would have been OK at $5 for 11 smallish dry shrimp, but not OK at nearly $10. \\n\\nAnd unfortunately our friends ordered two appetizers (expecting half price); the potato skins and the dry shrimp cocktail, and also ordered a side of Onion Soup.\\n\\nMy husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the steak and lobster special all four of us had. It was excellent. We all ordered it with a fully loaded baked potato and a side of Chef\\'s veggies. The steaks were cooked exactly the way we ordered them. \\n\\nOur waiter was Chris, and he did his best for us in a crazy busy setting.\\n\\nOur bill came to $41 (we only had water with our meals), and our friends bill came to over $75 (they had drinks). So in all the four of us spent about $120 plus a tip. The manager was not willing to adjust our bill for half price appetizers even after our waiter told him the Hostess failed to tell us we had to be seated in the bar. Oh well. If he had, this would have been a 4 star review.'b\"Quality of food was quite disappointing. Haven't been here in years and it still is mediocre at best. My lobster was burned and my ribs barely had any meat on them. My dad got the steak and lobster special, which is quite misleading for how small the lobster tail is. I could get a much better meal at a restaurant like Outback honestly.\"b\"I saw all the bad reviews after I had already been seated. I was expecting crap service and crap food. I got neither. Jeffrey was our waiter on a very busy Friday before Memorial Day. He was awesome. Brought water without even asking, and my biggest pet peeve, having an empty drink. Jeffrey brought a refill a little bit before my drink was even done. He was on point. \\n\\nThe food, after seeing the reviews I got scared and just ordered a burger. I was completely surprised at how nice and juicy it was. It didn't even need condiments. The fries were a little bit over seasoned but still yummy. \\n\\nWe even had dessert, something we never do. We got the fudge brownie with vanilla ice cream. Ah-mazing\"b'I won\\'t return to this location. \\n\\nOne thing I can\\'t stand is waiting for silverware to arrive, more so after your food arrives. It\\'s not the job of the hostess to bring napkins and figure out where our refills are. \\n\\nI ordered the Fridays Shrimp platter. It was ok. Nothing amazing and I\\'ve had better at other Friday\\'s locations.\\n\\nOur service was slow and it wasn\\'t even busy. I\\'m a pretty patient person and understand when it\\'s super busy that things have to wait. Waiting 15 minutes for your waitress to come back to your table to get the credit cards to pay while she just stands around and chit-chats isn\\'t cool.\\n\\nWe looked at the bill and noticed an error so we brought it to her attention that she added an item to the bill that we didn\\'t order. I guess she assumed that we wouldn\\'t see. She then stated, \"Oh yea, sorry, it happens sometimes\". \\n\\nWow. Nice. And the way she said it made it seem like it was done on purpose as if to round-up the bill to an even amount.'b'So far disappointed. We ordered potato skins and they came out looking fried and a blob of cheese that tasted microwaved.nothing like they used to serve. So far terrible.'b\"One of the worst places I've ever been to. I actually walked out upset.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately so the only good thing about this trip was there was no wait time, but FYI - Happy Hour only applies if you're sitting in the bar area.\\n\\nIt took 15 minutes for someone to come over and get our drink order, and another 10 for anything to arrive. A different waitress brought our drinks out and when we told her which one of us ordered what drink, she still gave us the wrong ones. Truly, I think maybe she was high. Meanwhile there are nothing but drunk people surrounding us, yelling obscenities and being inappropriate, and I'm sorry but one of the waiters smelled SO bad that it was hard not to cringe every time he came around. \\n\\nThe original waitress never came by and we didn't see her anymore for a while. It took us 15 minutes to get ANYONE'S attention and request the check, then another 10 for my card to be charged and brought back out to me. Easily the worst TGI Friday's I've ever been to and I will not be going back.\"b'Oh boy.... :( \\n\\n\\nCame here last night with the Gf, and we had a pretty bad experience ... We came in expecting a pretty good happy hour, with some beers and good food, right ? WRONG\\n\\n\\nFirst off, we were originally seated in the ( non happy hour section) so our waiter took us over to the bar.. Cool right ? Nah, we were seated at a high table top and waited around 10 minutes to be greeted and asked if we would like a drink .. Tick tock tick tick ... Waitress finally came, placed our drink order.. Meanwhile the bar is adjacent to us, it took around 10 minutes just to get a drink... We put the food order in and the food came out faster than the waitress checking up on us, and the drinks . Confused ? I was. The only good thing that came from that night was the $3 beers and the $10.99 rib special that was falsely advertised ... \\n\\nMy question was \" Where is the FOH manager ?\" I\\'ve worked in both FOH &amp; BOH and everything from the appearance and hygiene of the staff was horrible, like disgustingly horrible ... Nasty body odors, dirty hands . \\n\\nNever again'b'What great service! Our server was fantastic, drinks where all ways filled and food came out fast. Very pleased with my experience!'b\"Came here yesterday for happy hour with my boyfriend, we told the host we were there for happy hour which he said was only in the bar area. We looked in and saw several open tables but he told us there would be a 10 minute wait since there weren't enough servers in the section, no problem. So we said we'd grab a drink at the bar until a table was ready. After waiting at the bar for about 15 or 20 minutes, I told my boyfriend to go back to the host stand just to clarify that we still wanted a table, he did and the host assured him that he would come to the bar to get us when a table was ready. Well, that NEVER happened! After a few drinks at the bar we were starving so just ended up ordering food there, which was fine, but not what we had planned. We were going to just politely mention it to the host on the way out but he was nowhere to be found, my guess is his shift ended and he never told the next host about us. As far as service at the bar, it was friendly although somewhat slow considering that the bar was not very busy. I had been craving a frozen drink but the bartender said she was new and didn't think there was a menu with frozen drinks on it, but if I came up with something she'd make it. I did and it was fine, nothing special though and I just really would have liked to have some kind of specialty concoction at a chain like this. Our food was decent, nothing special though, and I realized after leaving that my appetizer was not discounted for happy hour, oh well. This was not a great experience and with so many other options in town I doubt I will go back.\"b\"I don't get how they only have 2 and a half stars!! It took a couple minutes for us to get seated but you need to understand stuff like that went there's only a server for the bar and one for the dining area. Not a problem to us. We get seated and within a few minutes our wonderful server got us our drinks. We ordered the nacho grande for an appetizer. It was so good! I loved every bit of it. The pico was so fresh and amazing! I got the jack ribs and shrimp and my boyfriend got Cajun shrimp and pasta. The ribs fell off the bones, so tender and amazing. The jack sauce was to die for, the shrimp was so crispy and good I cried a bit. His pasta was spicy but so good. I really loved it. Perfect amount of sauce and just everything. Andrea, our server, was consistent when it came to refills and such. She did really well! Next time I go back, I'm asking for her! I'm happy that the first time my boyfriend tried it, he loved it! Will be back. (:\"b\"Terrible. The food was nothing special and the service was even worse. To top it off, there was a hair in my food. Don't go here.\"b\"the food was ok, the 2 stars is more for the bad experience. \\n\\nI understand that its a huge restaurant, but management can at least give proper coverage to the  tables to ensure that all customers get a great experience while dinning. \\n\\nWe we're seated quick which was awesome, but after that everything else was on a snails pace. It was very disappointing. Our server was tending to almost 30 people which made the service very slow.. I was so thirsty and waited for my drink refill and water for a long time!! They we're faster clearing our table after than tending to our needs.\"b'I ordered the potato skins and they were GROSS!! The cheese was nasty, I seriously thought it was from their frozen food appetizers!! I ate 1 and was done!!'b'Just had awesome food, drinks and A+service from my favorite TGIFridays from Lance!!! I enjoyed a blackened salmon with a side salad (not on the menu) but my server Lance made it possible!! Even had a \"table touch\" from the General Manager Muneerah checking to see if everything was fantastic!! I will definitely be back!!'b\"Sat down at bar was given a menu. Red head Russian looking bartender hardly introduced herself and took forever to even ask me what I would like. Looked at menu knew what I want but bartender never came back. Got tired of waiting so I decided not to eat there and left. I've been to Friday's before but this by far is my worst experience. Its not the food but that bartender was horrible. Paid more attention to the locals and talked with people she knew.\"b'I was very disappointed when I went there for some beers and the all you can eat appetizers. The waiter said that everyone had to order that. That means I had to spend $60 for the special or my five friends had to order something they did not want. Huge disappointment. Since it was happy hour I moved to the bar area and got the happy hour specials. The mozzarella sticks were awesome and the bar server was fantastic.'b\"My family has been eating at this location for a few years, with no complaints. Sadly, that has changed. A recent visit, was more than disappointing. Went early to avoid the dinner rush. Was seated right away, but waited 15 minutes for a waitress to even come take our drink order. Took her more than 15 minutes to also get the drinks. Ordered right away, when she returned. Waited 30 minutes for appetizers. Canceled the dinner order and left after appetizers. This was before 5 pm and there were only a few customers in the restaurant. Don't know what the hold up was, but not willing to wait an hour for dinner.\"b\"While not 5 stars for the gourmet level of food, I'm rating 5 for the quality of service, accuracy of delivery and overall taste of the plate (Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta platter). Sorry, ate before I remembered to take a photo. \\n\\nFor neighborhood food and really good service (server was Brooke) I recommend.\"b'I usually get great service back home. So I expected the same when I was on vacation with the family. We decided to go to Friday\\'s on our last day in Vegas for the appetizers and to avoid the crowds. We were a party of eight so I expected a long wait. When I arrived the \"greeter\" didn\\'t greet us. She just said \"How many?\" She immediately said \"It\\'s gonna be a while\" but didn\\'t say how long. She looked stressed so I didn\\'t follow up. My wife then asked and she told her 30-45 min. When we were finally seated they gave us a table in the back which was empty. We were sitting for ten minutes before we grabbed a hostess and asked her for an appetizer menu. She said she would get one for us but never appeared again. The waitress finally came and we still hadn\\'t even been served water. I asked for water for everyone and she disappeared for another 5-10 min. She came back with the waters and took our orders. We waited another 10 minutes for our drink orders to arrive and 40 minutes for our food. When the drinks arrived one of the drinks was wrong. My son had to wait another 15 min for his Arnold Palmer. A few of our meals were endless appetizers but because of our poor service we put in a refill on the appetizer order and that took an additional 25 min to get. Overall I\\'m dissatisfied with the service. The food was great but because of the service I didn\\'t enjoy it at all.'b'A good place to have a beer or a casual dinner/lunch. The service is ok. Nice place to order a takeout though.'b\"Great Server, Thank You Jessica!!! You Saved the night -- I would have left One Star except, I heard yelling in the kitchen- Those Frigin Morons behind the Window argued with Her about every simple little Thing!!! I tried to tip the hostess to be sat in a good section (she didn't take it) But Apparently I was put in the right section --- FYI, a bun should never be cold and I've learned to tip people ahead of time for good service- My Girl Said You Saved the Night\"b\"Kind of surprised by the amount of bad reviews. My father just stayed at the Orleans for the last week and we stopped in here many times for appetizers and drinks mainly. I'd reccomend bar area for seating. Happy hour has some good deals on appetizers and drinks in there. Always polite and prompt service from the wait staff. Food always came out hot and fresh. I only wish this location was 24 hours because the tgi Fridays at Gold Coast is terrible compared to this one.\"b\"I'm sad that this TGIF only has 3 stars !!\\nThis is the only one I go to because we always receive the best customer service and our food has never been wrong.\\nOn this night my friends and I went for a quick meal before going to piranha. We ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta (I HAVE to order this every time) it has a little spicy kick, the chicken, shrimp and red bell peppers are what makes this dish my favorite. I can't get enough go try it. I believe it's $15? I also ordered a raspberry mint patron drink. Very good but I wouldn't recommend it with the pasta- too much acid. This drink was $10 probably would've been cheaper to just get a drink at the casino! Lastly the only flaw I have is that if you don't sit at the bar when they have their half off drinks, you don't get them- unless you walk to the bar and pay every time. They should just make it half off no matter what I'm sure they would sell more!\\nLastly I want the endless appetizers back!\"b\"DO NOT EAT HERE\\xe2\\x80\\xbc\\xe2\\x80\\xbc \\n\\nI went after I went to a movie I was starving I ordered a steak with a side salad ...... It was about 1am or so when I left I went home took a shower went to sleep\\n\\nWhen I woke up I felt like DEATH! I woke up drenched in sweat had to run straight to the bathroom.... I had such bad pains in my stomach u had never felt them before in my life\\n\\nI went to the doctor and lord and behold FOOD POISONING..... \\n\\nI will never return I've never had food poison before and I want to never get it again EVER it's horrible unless u enjoy bonding with the toilet\"b'I was wondering why this Fridays only received 3 stars on average from yelp  reviewers. Now I see why and completely understand. This Fridays capitalizes on the fact that it is inside the gold coast. Don\\'t think your going to see and get what you typically get from a city Fridays. Add at least $5 to $10 more on the meals and you get less food. \\n\\nSecondly, you better hope you get a good waiter/waitress. The last visit I had the waitress seemed nice enough at first, but as soon as I asked for more cheese for my salad and asked if it came with a slice of bread or crackers.? She said for a $1 I can get you a bread stick. I asked her to confirm that my $15 salad didn\\'t come with ANY bread? Oh why did I ask that, she looked at me and said \"do you want the bread sticks or not!\" ..I just declined and ate my salad in silence. Her tip was a note that said \"its not always what you say, it\\'s how you say it! And Of course I left a .25 cent tip to further express my satisfaction with my dining experience. A tip is not Mandatory and automatic people. Not with me. I\\'m paying for the food full price, the tip you earn! E A R N! I\\'m sure nothing will change at this location because it\\'s the only 24 hour dinning restaurant on the property. The only reason I\\'m not putting that waitress on blast, is Because I forgot her name. She\\'s lucky!...this time....'b'The food was great! Super fast service too! Our waiter, Donne, was a fantastic waiter! He got our food fast, was very kind, and most of all just a very nice man. My little brother basically needed to go to the restroom, keep in mind he is 10 years old, Donne  had offered to leave and take him all the way to the bathroom and back for us. Donne is the definition of a perfect waiter! Thank you so much!'b'This was my first time at this location and it was just alright. The waiter was nice but kinda slacked on the service.'b\"Not much stood out, but I have no complaints. A group of fussy/ special dietary needs people caused a lot of extra trips to the kitchen for the waitress, but she made no mistakes. I was so full from the lunch buffet (and the 17 prior huge meals), that I just sampled everyone else's dishes. The Jack Daniels meals were good. The sides were standard. They gave us coupons for free desserts, and the brownie sundae wasn't bad. \\n\\nWe were a bit disappointed that happy hour was available only in the bar most of the time.\"b\"Four of us went to a movie and stopped at TGI Friday's afterwards for dinner. They have a special steak and lobster that was extremely good.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection.  Served with a very fresh baked potato and really good broccoli. I personally am not a fan of lobster but was extremely impressed the flavor was tender and sweet. I am definitely a fan and would definitely come back here. Service was fabulous.\"b'My bf, sister and I came to eat, late night, on Thursday 11/13. Gabriel was outstanding and the service was, over all, phenomenal. He promptly guided us through the entire happy hour menu, and suggested some of his favorites. Since he was unable to accept our cash tip, I decided to give a shout out for his excellent service. Will definitely be back! Thank you so much for the great hospitality.'b'Our server was Vivian and she was amazing!!! She went out of her way to make sure we were happy. The food was delicious!'b\"Conveniently located inside of the Orleans, this TGI Friday's location is a great place to go eat before or after bowling, the movies, or just a nice place to go eat food at. The prices are comparable to TGI Friday's outside of casinos and have the safe offerings as other TGI Friday's. During my last visit, our server was really nice and informative. The food was up to par. My friends ordered their wings and I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. I absolutely love the Jack Daniel's sauce and the reason I get Jack Daniel entrees. The sandwich was delicious, but it was missing the fried onion strings. Their sweet potato fries were top notch in my opinion and made the meal that much more enjoyable. Overall, a good place to eat if you like the uniqueness TGI Friday's has to offer, but nothing stands out to me that puts TGI Friday's above the rest.\"b'I went here in May 29, 2014.\\n\\nThe food here was pretty good, but a little over priced, especially overpriced were the potstickers. The waiter barely acknowledged us and we felt ripped off for the service that we received. The portions served were ok for the price we paid. Not worth a visit unless you want horrible service and ok to good food.'b'Giving a 3 star for a server whose nice but he took forever to get our box food to go and the tab . Food quality is good i mean i got the petite steak and salmon medium well with rice and brocolli atlleast thats good ! But the waiting sucks !!'b'Quality Burgers here. Love the Crispy Onion, Bacon Topping. Patty about half pound. Fabulous Char flavor on the QUALITY meat. Bun tender and fresh made daily.\\n\\nSaw the steaks lobster tail. Ribs(Hint). TGIF Place was packed. At late night in the Orleans Casino. Its just Wednesday. Actually its past midnight. So its Thursday.\\n\\nThis Oleans casino is a Definite Fav of LV Locals and our family. I mean. Has 70 lane bowling. 18 movie Theaters. An Arena showing special events. Our Super Deluxe 2 Queen, with Living area with Sofa, Couch, Coffee Table, even separate area with desk and chair cost us about  $45 weekdays.\\n\\nOk. Now can focus on the Oyster Bar eatery, heard their Clam Chowder is the Boooooomb',)</th>\n",

       "      <th>(b'AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!! The Owner is an Animal. As I was outside the umbrella came flying out of the table and hit my car and almost hit my wife. The \"owner\" could not have been less remorseful. I told him that it was a safety hazard and he replied; \"What do you want me to do about it?\" I then shook my head and told him he was an idiot, at that point he tried to start a fistfight with me. This guy is out of his mind and should most likely be in prison!'b'First time checking this place out so I ordered their namesake with carne asada. The difference between their regular burrito and a super burrito is that the super burrito has everything the regular burrito has (beans, lettuce, tomato and cheese) but has sour cream and avocado. Price difference was about 1.50. To me the price difference was a bit steep because the burrito itself was not all that big. You would think a \"Super Burrito\" would be a pretty nice sized portion. \\n\\nThe burrito comes with chips that they made themselves from scratch. You can tell just by the taste alone. The only thing I thought that was lacking was that they don\\'t give you much chips to begin with. Of course if you want more you have to pay extra. \\n\\nSince I was dining in, they gave me two squeeze bottles of hot sauce. One was red (spicy) and the other was green (med). Both were I thought very flavorful. \\n\\nTheir establishment was pretty spacious and clean. The employees are friendly. They asked me several times if I needed anything and that everything was ok. \\n\\nOverall I had a nice experience. I just thought that their burritos especially their \"Super Burrito\" should be a lot bigger in size since it\\'s called that. My burrito satisfied me but I feel I should have had a hard time breathing after eating a \"Super Burrito\".'b\"The first time I saw their sign i lol'ed because it says Super Burrito Super Good!\\n\\nTo my surprise i actually really like the super burrito. Fresh made when ordered. The restaurant is clean and people are friendly.\"b'Man everything on the menue os good and they give a taste of there product. I got a burrito with carne asada inside and green sauce pork. Soooo good!!!!! The owner is a very friendly guy.'b\"I love this place!  I first expereinced Super Burrito at an office party.  I ordered the pork tacos and was blown away by the freshness and tastiness of the taco.\\n\\nNeedless to say since that office party I have been to the Henderson establishment at least once a week.  I usually get the carne-asada quesadilla, taco and enchllata.   A friend of mine recommended that I try Roberto's  taco show and boy was I disappointed.  I could not, for the life of me, understand how anyone could eat there if there is an option like Super Burrito.\\n\\nIf you like fast &amp; more importantly FRESH Mexican, this is your spot.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that they do not use refried beans.   They use pinto (i think?) .  I can not allow that to affect my ratings, since that is a personal preference.\"b\"OMG the chicken bowl was great - I'm on the HGC diet &amp; it's hard finding a place to eat out - so I figured Mexican - boy was I right! I ordered a chicken bowl with only pico .... it needed Nothing else ... really satisfying.  Place was clean &amp; spacious modern... Staff was very friendly, gotta go back &amp; try the beef one... keep you posted.\"b'I have been to Super Burrito a few times.  The sign has always caught my attention.  I mean I like regular burritos, but a \"Super\" burrito sounds better.  I went on my lunch break and the I couldn\\'t make up my mind.  I mean there aren\\'t that many items on the menu.  I was pretty sure I was going to get a burrito.  That makes sense right?  The guy watching the counter was really helpful.  He made a few suggestions and told me what he sells the most of.  I ended up just getting the carne asada burrito.  You can\\'t go wrong with grilled beef.  It was made pretty fast, so if your are here for lunch, don\\'t worry about waiting too long.  The burrito was a good size.  It wasn\\'t huge, which was ok because I didn\\'t want to fall asleep at my desk when I got back.  The burrito had a big garlic taste.  That was the only thing I didn\\'t like.  The taste stayed with me the rest of day.  It was just a little too much.  The meat was cooked perfect and the tortilla tasted good too.  I drowned it in the green salsa they had.  If you are in the area or on a lunch break you have to check this place out.  They have a drive thru if you want to take it to go.  Cheers!'b'Pros: Pretty good burritos.  Good street tacos.  I have found better.  They do have really good Chile Verde.'b\"So go thru the drive thru and get ignored. No one answers then decide ok I will go inside. Once inside the only person in the place doesn't acknowledge I am there while he is making good and I am there at the counter waiting 20 min and not one word. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!\"b\"Their green sauce is so amazing I would buy a gallon if they let me and eat it like soup! Can't go wrong with any one of the burritos just pure yummy!\"b'I think they must have gone out of business, I was there at 815 am hours are posted 8-10. All dark no one inside no answer on the phone.'b\"BOMB.COM for sure!!! I absolutely love this place!!! My favorite is there San Francisco Burrito ($5.95) it has carne asada, fresh pico de gallo, BACON, French fries. If I came here first I'd think Robertos was biting off them. Much cleaner than Robertos, I want to same the prices are about the same but the quality of the meat and seasonings in there burritos are by far way better than Robertos! Super quick service. I literally had my burrito 3 minutes after ordering. FRESHLY MADE! The serving size is huuuuuge! DONT EVEN LET ME GET STARTED ON THEIR GREEN SAUCE! SALSA VERDE IS THE BESSSST! I can finish a bottle all by myself with just one burrito! I have to have it in every bite! You will not be disappointed! Whenever I'm just craving a burrito, this is my go to spot. Definitely. They do have fries, nachos, tortas, combo plates etc. It's definitely a must try if you haven't already!\"b'The Eastern location is closed. I looked for it 10/22/15 to go eat there, drove around the parking lot.  Tried to google it and  was listed as permanently closed.',)</th>\n",

       "      <th>(b'The Las Vegas Strip is the adult Disney Land. And the majority of restaurants charge Disney Land prices for food. When I want to save money on the Strip, I will visit a fast food restaurant. Last night, I tried the newest McDonald\\'s on the Strip.\\n\\n   This McDonald\\'s opened a few weeks after the Harmon Road pedestrian overpass. It is located at the lower right corner of the new mall that went up at the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon Road, below the new Harmon Road pedestrian bridge. It is a modern two-story McDonald\\'s that would fit in at Midtown Manhattan. In contrast to the McDonald\\'s about a block away the outside is more low key. Instead of giant arches there is only an \"M.\" With the exception of somebody asking me for change (expected on the Strip) it felt like I was eating in a classy fast food restaurant. The interior is modernism and everything is new.\\n\\n Kudos to McDonald\\'s for keeping that price relative to the off strip locations. in my opinion paying approximately $8 for a ranch BLT value meal large size is worth it. \\n\\n   With restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip charging Disney Land prices, sometimes McDonald\\'s will do. I see myself returning to the newest McDonald\\'s on the Strip.'b'In the three days I was in Vegas I went to Mc Donalds five times. Four out of the five times was at this location. I told myself that I would not go to Mc Dinalds but I have to admit how handy this place was. Sometimes when your drunk and hungry a fifthteen dollar burger isnt going to cut it, sometimes you just need a dollar menu. Great location. Get filled up for less here.'b'Great place to stop in for a late night snack and escape the high prices of the strip.  It was very crowded when I went, but true to the fast food industry name, my order came out very quick.'b\"This is probably the worst McDonald's I've been to.\"b\"It's Vegas. People are already walking outside. It's kinda crowded and it's only about 830AM. I was hesitant to see all the people standing inside but I needed to get something quick and simple for my boyfriend.\\n\\nLet me tell you; I was in/out in maybe 5 minutes tops! I ordered two egg white breakfast sandwiches, two large orange juices, and a side order of pancakes. I ordered, walked off to go stand in a corner and my order was ready! I was blown away!\\n\\nStaff are quick, efficient, and on-point. Kudos to all these employees for working so hard and fast to cater to everyone down here!\"b\"Worst McDonalds that I have ever been to. Weird and rude staff. I don't know who, in the god's name, hired them.\"b'Staff was friendly for a McDonalds and food was quick since most ingredients were precooked.  However, the southern chicken biscuit was precooked so much it was disgustingly dry.  The patty was tough and chewy.  Yuck!'b\"This McDonald's was across the street from the Cosmopolitan where I was staying at. I think this was the closest one to me. I ended up coming here twice for breakfast during my last trip to vegas. The location of this McDonald's is really good. It's located right off the street. The inside of the place was nice. They had two levels for additional seating upstairs since there wasn't that much downstairs. The food and service was good. Came here for breakfast and ordered sausage mcmuffins and hash browns.\\n\\nThis place wasn't packed and the lines weren't that long. So it was good that we didn't have to wait long for our food each time we went. Definitely a good place to stop to get a bite to eat quick and easy. Prices are what you would expect so at least you aren't getting ripped off for expensive bagels, muffins or croissants! I'll probably stop by here again if I stay near this place the next time I go to vegas.\"b'A female employee did not close the coffee lid tight, so when I grabbed the coffee cup, it spilled on my hand and my hand got burned.  Despite of my shout in pain, she did not give any attention and ignored my request to close the coffee lid tight for the customers.  @#$%^&amp;*!!!!!  Horrible service!'b\"I feel jiped on the fries and they didn't have the toy my daughter wanted but I don't see much difference in this McDonald's compared to other McDonald's.\",)</th>\n",
